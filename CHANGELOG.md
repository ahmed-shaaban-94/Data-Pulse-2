## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Phase 1 workspace setup: `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `tsconfig.base.json`,
  `.eslintrc.cjs`, `.prettierrc`, `.nvmrc`, root `package.json`,
  `docker-compose.dev.yml`, Constitution-Check PR template.

## [0.1.0] — Foundation backend — 2026-05-12

### Added

#### Workspace and package layer
- pnpm workspace with two deployable services (`apps/api`, `apps/worker`)
  and four internal packages (`packages/auth`, `packages/contracts`,
  `packages/db`, `packages/shared`).
- Shared primitives: Zod base schemas, error envelope, pino logger factory
  with `tenant_id`/`request_id` binding, OpenTelemetry SDK setup (HTTP,
  Postgres, Redis, BullMQ instrumentations), UUIDv7 generator with UUIDv4
  fallback, idempotency key store (Redis-primary, Postgres-mirror).

#### Database schema and migrations
- Drizzle schema for all foundation entities: `users`, `tenants`, `stores`,
  `memberships`, `store_access`, `roles`, `permissions`, `role_permissions`,
  `sessions`, `auth_tokens` (with reserved `device_id` POS seam column),
  `invitations`, `audit_events`, `idempotency_keys`.
- Explicit SQL migration `packages/db/drizzle/0000_initial.sql` with
  rollback: `citext` extension, tables in dependency order, FK and CHECK
  constraints, `updated_at` triggers, RLS enabled and policies applied.
- `withTenant` query proxy and DB-session middleware that issues
  `SET LOCAL app.current_tenant` and `SET LOCAL app.is_platform_admin`
  per transaction.
- Testcontainers-backed migration integration test verifying all tables,
  FKs, partial uniques, CHECK constraints, RLS policies, and triggers.

#### API — auth
- `AuthGuard` (cookie + bearer token paths), `AuthService` (sign-in,
  password verify, argon2id, account lockout), `AuthController` (sign-in,
  sign-out, refresh, password-reset request/confirm,
  email-verify request/confirm).
- `SessionRepository` (PostgreSQL source of truth, Redis read-through cache),
  `AuthTokenRepository` (opaque SHA-256 token hash, revocation, expiry).
- Rate-limit helper: per-account 5/15 min, per-IP 30/hour (Redis-backed).
- `@Roles()` decorator + `RolesGuard`; predefined v1 role catalog with
  forward-compatible permissions table.

#### API — tenants, stores, and memberships
- `TenantsController` + `TenantsService`: CRUD, slug uniqueness,
  cross-tenant isolation, platform-admin gating, soft-delete.
- `StoresController` + `StoresService`: CRUD within active tenant,
  store-code uniqueness, cross-store isolation.
- `InvitationsController` + `InvitationsService`: create, accept, revoke,
  expiry; invitation token visible once, only hash persisted.
- `MembershipsController` + `MembershipsService`: role and store-access
  updates, membership revocation with audit.

#### API — active context
- `TenantContextGuard` and `ContextController`/`ContextService`: active
  tenant switch, active store switch/clear; cross-tenant store attempts
  return 404 indistinguishable from not-found (FR-ISO-4).
- DB middleware wires `app.current_tenant` GUC into the NestJS request
  lifecycle for every authenticated request.

#### API — audit
- `AuditEmitter` interceptor enqueues a BullMQ job for each auditable
  action: auth sign-in (success/failure), role/access changes, context
  switch, soft-delete, platform-admin cross-tenant operations.
- `AuditController` + `AuditService`: filters by action prefix, actor,
  store, time range; cursor pagination; tenant-scoped; tenant-admin gated.
- PII/credential redaction enforced at the logger boundary; audit rows
  are insert-only at the application layer.

#### API — common infrastructure
- `RequestIdInterceptor` (UUID assignment + response header),
  `LoggingInterceptor` (pino per-request line, no secrets),
  global `ExceptionFilter` (uniform error envelope; 404 = 403 = cross-tenant
  per FR-ISO-4), Zod `ValidationPipe`.
- OpenAPI loader reads YAMLs from `packages/contracts/openapi/` at startup.

#### Worker foundations
- NestJS standalone worker bootstrap with BullMQ connection and graceful
  shutdown.
- BullMQ default options module with configurable retry/backoff/DLQ
  defaults across all queues.
- Email processor (verify + password-reset flows) with provider-agnostic
  adapter interface (no concrete provider chosen — PQ-1 stub).
- `audit-fanout` processor: consumes BullMQ, inserts `audit_events` row;
  retry/backoff; DLQ on terminal failure.
- `session-revoke` processor: admin-initiated session revocation propagates
  within ≤5 minutes (FR-AUTH-6); processor and registry layer complete.
- Soft-delete sweep processor layer (T312): processor slice scaffolded;
  runtime scheduling is not yet wired (Layer A only).
- OpenTelemetry trace context propagation from API → worker via BullMQ
  job payload (`trace_id`/`span_id` flows through `audit-fanout`,
  `session-revoke`, and email queues).

#### Contracts and conformance
- OpenAPI 3.1 YAML contracts of record under `packages/contracts/openapi/`
  for auth, tenants, stores, context, memberships, and audit domains.
- Contract-conformance test coverage for `GET /tenants`, `GET /stores`,
  and `PATCH /memberships` endpoints (additional slices in progress).

#### Coverage and quality
- Jest coverage threshold ≥ 80% configured at repo root and per-app.
- Unit coverage established across all core repositories, services,
  controllers, guards, interceptors, and worker processors.
- Codecov reporting integrated via CI.

#### Documentation
- `README.md` quickstart pointer links to
  `specs/001-foundation-auth-tenant-store/quickstart.md`.
- Foundation spec, plan, data model, contracts, and 140-task implementation
  plan under `specs/001-foundation-auth-tenant-store/`.

### Notes
- Dashboard UI and POS application are out of scope and not implemented.
- POS sync API endpoints are not implemented; `/api/pos/v1/*` namespace
  is reserved (returns the standard not-found envelope).
- T311 audit log retention policy is not yet implemented (pending
  retention schema and design decisions).
- T312 soft-delete sweep processor layer is complete; runtime scheduling
  is not yet wired.
- T309 SC-1..SC-9 verification and T308 Constitution post-implementation
  sign-off are not yet recorded.
- Product catalog, inventory, orders, payments, billing, reports,
  analytics, dbt, and ClickHouse are explicitly out of scope.

## [0.1.0-foundation] — Planning baseline

### Added
- Project Constitution v2.0.0 (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`).
- Foundation feature spec, plan, contracts (OpenAPI 3.1), data model,
  quickstart, and 140-task implementation plan under
  `specs/001-foundation-auth-tenant-store/`.

### Notes
- No application code shipped at this baseline.
- Dashboard UI, POS app, POS sync, product catalog, inventory, orders,
  payments, billing, reports, and analytics/dbt are explicitly out of
  scope of the foundation feature.
