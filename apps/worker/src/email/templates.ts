/**
 * Email templates — slice 5 (T115).
 *
 * Pure functions. No I/O. No `process.env`. No URL construction from
 * env vars (no front-end origin is wired into the worker yet — PQ-1).
 * The rawToken is embedded into the body as the source of truth; a
 * future slice that introduces a UI will format it inside a clickable
 * link. Until then, the recipient sees the token directly, which is
 * perfectly functional for the auth flows in scope.
 *
 * Why no userId in the body, subject, or tags?
 * --------------------------------------------
 * The recipient already knows who they are; surfacing their internal
 * UUID would be an unforced PII leak (it can show in mail-archive
 * search, screenshots, support pastes, etc.). The producer's `userId`
 * is for audit / dedupe only — the templates discard it.
 *
 * Tags
 * ----
 * `template_id` is a stable, non-PII label that real providers
 * (SendGrid, Postmark, etc.) use for analytics. We pre-emptively put
 * one on every message so the future provider integration has the
 * dashboard hook it needs without a template change.
