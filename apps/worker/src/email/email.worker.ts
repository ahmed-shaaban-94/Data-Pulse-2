/**
 * EmailWorker — slice 6 (T090) + T301-partial wiring.
 *
 * Thin BullMQ glue. Knows two things and only two things:
 *   1. The queue name (`"email"`, mirroring `apps/api/src/auth/auth.module.ts`).
 *   2. How to delegate `(job.name, job.data)` to the injected
 *      `EmailProcessor` from PR #15.
 *
 * Everything else — provider SDK selection (PQ-1), per-queue metrics —
 * lives in other slices. Retry/backoff/DLQ defaults are read from
 * `@data-pulse-2/shared/queues/queue-config` (single source of truth)
 * and forwarded to the underlying BullMQ worker via `WorkerFactory`.
 *
 * Why a `WorkerFactory` instead of constructing `new Worker(...)` here?
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   - Tests can inject a `FakeWorkerFactory` and capture the registered
 *     handler + options without booting Redis or BullMQ.
 *   - Production wiring (`worker.module.ts`) injects a
 *     `BullMqWorkerFactory` that builds the real BullMQ `Worker`.
 *   - Same `*Like`-interface pattern PR #14 (`QueueLike`) and PR #15
 *     (`RecordingEmailAdapter`) used. One repo idiom.
 *
 * Lifecycle
 * ---------
 *   - `start()` constructs the underlying worker via the factory,
 *     passing `DEFAULT_WORKER_OPTIONS` from shared, and subscribes to
 *     its `"error"` event for diagnostic logging only.
 *   - `close()` shuts the worker down cleanly (drains in-flight jobs).
 *     Called by Nest's `onModuleDestroy` hook, which `main.ts` triggers
 *     on SIGTERM / SIGINT.
 *
 * Idempotent: calling `start()` twice or `close()` before `start()` is
 * tolerated; the test pins both behaviours.
