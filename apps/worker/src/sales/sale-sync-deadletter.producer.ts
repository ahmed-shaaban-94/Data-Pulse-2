/**
 * Sale-sync NEEDS_REPAIR / RETRYABLE quarantine PRODUCER — 032 §8 / T030.
 *
 * The write half the classifier (T029) feeds: given a classified sync failure
 * for one sale, it (a) writes a `sale_sync_deadletters` quarantine row with
 * PROVENANCE INTACT (028) and (b) advances `sales.sync_status` to the matching
 * `failed-*` state — atomically, in ONE transaction, under tenant RLS. THIS is
 * what makes US2's NEEDS_REPAIR list + repair op non-inert: before this, the
 * `sale_sync_deadletters` table existed (migration 0026) but nothing wrote it.
 *
 * NEVER A SILENT DROP (Principle V / XIII)
 * ----------------------------------------
 * A non-retryable failure produces a durable `needs-repair` row the Console can
 * see and an operator can repair; a transient failure produces a `retryable`
 * row with retry accounting. Neither path loses the sale or its provenance.
 *
 * ATOMICITY
 * ---------
 * `runWithTenantContext` opens a transaction (BEGIN/COMMIT) and sets the RLS
 * GUCs. The deadletter INSERT and the `sales` UPDATE run on the SAME client
 * inside that one transaction, so they commit or roll back together — a partial
 * quarantine (row written but status not advanced, or vice-versa) is impossible.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENCY (at-least-once safe)
 * -------------------------------
 * The deadletter INSERT is guarded against the `uq_sale_sync_deadletters_open`
 * partial-unique index (one OPEN row per sale) by an
 * `ON CONFLICT ... WHERE resolved_at IS NULL DO NOTHING`: a re-delivery of the
 * same failure is a no-op insert, not a duplicate row and not a throw. The
 * `sales` status UPDATE is guarded so it only advances a sale that is NOT
 * already in a terminal-success (`synced`) state — a failure classification
 * must never clobber a sale a concurrent drain already synced (§XI converge,
 * the SaleProcessingProcessor `processed_at IS NULL` precedent).
 *
 * NO SALE-FACT REWRITE
 * --------------------
 * The immutable `sales` / `sale_lines` / terminal-event facts are untouched;
 * only the SaaS-owned `sync_status` column moves and a separate quarantine row
 * is added. No money, no line amounts, no PII, no raw payload is written or
 * logged (the `reason_code` is the classifier's redacted machine label).
 *
 * METRICS — DEFERRED (documented gap), NOT silently skipped
 * ---------------------------------------------------------
 * T030 calls for the §VII signals (failed-job rate, reconciliation mismatch
 * rate). The worker metric registry (`observability/metrics/worker.metrics.ts`)
 * gates its label sets (`WORKER_JOB_NAMES` / `WORKER_QUEUE_NAMES`) and the
 * shared `ALLOWED_METRIC_LABELS` allowlist behind a cardinality review
 * (FR-B-012); `worker.module.ts` itself flags adding a `sale-processing` entry
 * as "forbidden" / deferred to a monitoring follow-up, and those files are
 * OUTSIDE this slice's lock scope. There is no existing helper whose domain
 * fits a sale-sync dead-letter (`erpnext_posting_reconciliation_total` is the
 * ERPNext posting domain, not sale-sync). Registering a new sale-sync signal
 * here would either silently grow a gated bounded set or fail the label-policy
 * assertion at module load. So metric EMISSION is deferred to the monitoring
 * slice that owns those files — the same precedent as the deferred queue-lag /
 * DLQ entries for `sale-processing`. The quarantine itself (the durable row +
 * status advance) is the §VII data source that slice will count.
 *
 * LIVE DRAIN-TRIGGER — KNOWN GAP (deferred, the 008 precedent)
 * -----------------------------------------------------------
 * This producer is the tested CAPABILITY; it is NOT yet auto-fired from the
 * `SaleProcessingProcessor` failure branch, and is NOT registered in
 * `worker.module.ts` (that file is outside this slice's `apps/worker/src/sales/**`
 * lock scope, exactly as the 008 enqueue-wiring + metrics-emission were deferred
 * to their own slices). Wiring it means: classify a caught processor error ->
 * needs-repair -> `quarantine(...)`; transient -> a guarded `failed-retryable`
 * write that won't clobber a concurrent `synced` (this producer already does
 * that), then rethrow for BullMQ backoff. That additive change touches the
 * processor happy path + the module DI graph and is left to the wiring slice so
 * the F-invariants are reviewed there. Until then, US2's NEEDS_REPAIR list +
 * repair op are non-inert WHENEVER a caller invokes this producer (e.g. a
 * test/seed or the future trigger); the table is no longer write-dead.
