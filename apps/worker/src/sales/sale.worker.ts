/**
 * SaleWorker — 008 WIRING slice.
 *
 * Thin BullMQ glue, structurally identical to `AuditWorker` / `EmailWorker`.
 * Knows two things and only two things:
 *   1. The queue name (`"sale-processing"`).
 *   2. How to delegate each job's envelope to the injected
 *      `SaleProcessingProcessor` from `sale-processing.processor.ts`.
 *
 * Why this slice exists (the functional gap it closes)
 * ----------------------------------------------------
 * `SaleProcessingProcessor` (the Layer-A off-request processor) was merged
 * without a BullMQ `Worker` bootstrap or `worker.module.ts` registration — the
 * processor's own docstring flags this as a KNOWN GAP deferred to "a future
 * worker wiring slice". This is that slice. Without it the worker process
 * cannot consume sale-processing jobs at all.
 *
 * Queue name — DEFINED here, not pinned to a producer (yet)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------
 * `AuditWorker.AUDIT_QUEUE_NAME` mirrors an existing API-side producer
 * constant. There is NO sale-processing producer yet: the enqueue (outbox →
 * queue) half is a SEPARATE, currently-deferred slice. `SalesService` emits a
 * `sale.captured` outbox event, but (a) `SALES_OUTBOX_PRODUCER` is not bound in
 * `SalesModule` and (b) `sale.captured` is not in `OUTBOX_EVENT_TYPES` (which
 * holds only `audit.event.created`). Wiring that half touches `apps/api/src/**`
 * and the gated `packages/db` registry — out of scope here.
 *
 * Therefore `SALE_PROCESSING_QUEUE_NAME` is the canonical literal this worker
 * consumes; the future enqueue side MUST match this string. A cross-app pin
 * test (mirroring `audit.worker.spec.ts`'s `AUDIT_QUEUE_NAME` pin) can be added
 * once a producer constant exists to pin against.
 *
 * Handler shape — differs from AuditWorker
 * -----------------------------------------
 * `AuditFanoutProcessor.process(jobName, data)` takes `(name, data)`.
 * `SaleProcessingProcessor.process(job)` takes the ENVELOPE
 * (`SaleProcessingJob` = `{ saleId, tenantId, storeId, correlationId? }`) and
 * returns a `SaleProcessingResult`. The handler therefore forwards
 * `job.data` (cast to the envelope) and discards the result to satisfy the
 * shared `JobLike → Promise<void>` handler contract. The processor's own
 * `assertJob` is the validation boundary (the audit analogue is its Zod
 * schema) — the worker does NOT re-validate.
 *
 * Tenant context (§II / §V)
 * -------------------------
 * The worker establishes NO tenant context itself — the processor owns that
 * via `runWithTenantContext` before any tenant-scoped DB access. This wrapper
 * must not bypass or pre-empt it; it only delegates.
 *
 * Why a `WorkerFactory` instead of `new Worker(...)` here?
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 * Same idiom as Email/Audit: tests inject a `FakeWorkerFactory` to capture the
 * registered handler + options with no Redis/BullMQ; production injects the
 * shared `BullMqWorkerFactory`.
 *
 * Lifecycle — self-starting (controlled divergence from AuditWorker)
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   - `onModuleInit()` calls `start()`. This is the ONE deliberate divergence
 *     from `AuditWorker`: `EmailWorker` / `AuditWorker` are started imperatively
 *     by `apps/worker/src/main.ts` (`emailWorker.start()` / `auditWorker.start()`),
 *     but `main.ts` is outside this slice's allowed files. Self-starting via
 *     `OnModuleInit` is the in-scope way to make the wiring genuinely functional
 *     (registration alone would never consume a job — Nest never calls a custom
 *     `start()`). The precedent is `OutboxDrainerRunner.onModuleInit()`, which
 *     starts its loop the same way. In dev / test the shared `WORKER_FACTORY`
 *     resolves to `NoOpWorkerFactory`, so auto-start is a harmless no-op (no
 *     Redis, no job consumption).
 *   - `start()` constructs the underlying worker via the factory, forwards
 *     `DEFAULT_WORKER_OPTIONS`, and subscribes to `"error"` for diagnostic
 *     logging only. Idempotent (second `start()` is a no-op).
 *   - `close()` shuts the worker down cleanly; tolerated before `start()` and
 *     idempotent. Wired to `onModuleDestroy`.

   * `AuditWorker`) land together in the gated enqueue-wiring slice, so the whole
   * live capture→process loop becomes functional in one consistent place.
