/**
 * drizzle-outbox-retention.repository.ts -- T590 production repository.
 *
 * Two implementations:
 *
 *   DrizzleOutboxRetentionRepository -- real pg.Pool-backed repo. Wraps each
 *     batched DELETE in `runWithTenantContext({ tenantId: null,
 *     isPlatformAdmin: true })` so the platform-admin OR-branch of the
 *     outbox_events RLS policy grants visibility across every tenant.
 *
 *   NoOpOutboxRetentionRepository -- dev/test fallback for the safe path
 *     where AuditDbPool.pool is null. Paired with NoOpWorkerFactory: no
 *     jobs flow, no rows are touched. Mirrors NoOpAuditRetentionRepository.
 *
 * SQL contract
 * ------------
 * The DELETE pins the same three-branch retention predicate locked by
 * packages/db/__tests__/outbox/retention.spec.ts (ELIGIBLE_SQL constant):
 *
 *   - delivered + event_type <> 'audit.event.created' + processed_at < $1
 *   - delivery_state IN ('failed','dead_lettered')
 *     + COALESCE(processed_at, updated_at) < $2
 *   - delivered + event_type = 'audit.event.created' + processed_at < $2
 *
 * Where $1 = deliveredCutoff (90 days ago) and $2 = failedCutoff (365 days
 * ago). Active rows (pending/claimed) are excluded by construction.
 *
 * The inner candidate SELECT uses `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED LIMIT $3` so:
 *   - Concurrent drainer ticks (which also use FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED on
 *     the same table) are NOT blocked -- the two pick disjoint row sets.
 *   - Concurrent retention sweeps across replicas converge without
 *     double-deleting; each replica processes a disjoint batch.
 *
 * The outer DELETE uses `WHERE event_id IN (SELECT ...)` rather than a
 * direct `DELETE ... FOR UPDATE` because Postgres does not support FOR
 * UPDATE on DELETE statements directly -- the inner select grabs the
 * locks, the outer DELETE executes against the locked id set.
 *
 * Ordering by `occurred_at ASC` so the oldest eligible rows are purged
 * first; this is deterministic across runs and makes operator
 * observability ("which row class was purged first?") predictable.
 *
 * Payload is NEVER read. The predicate keys on delivery_state, event_type,
 * processed_at, and updated_at only -- the right-to-erasure pass-through
 * contract (retention.spec.ts RT-4) is preserved.
