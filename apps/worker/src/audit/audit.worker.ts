/**
 * AuditWorker — PR-D wiring slice.
 *
 * Thin BullMQ glue, structurally identical to `EmailWorker`. Knows two
 * things and only two things:
 *   1. The queue name (`"audit"`, mirroring `AUDIT_QUEUE_NAME` in
 *      `apps/api/src/audit/audit-queue.producer.ts`).
 *   2. How to delegate `(job.name, job.data)` to the injected
 *      `AuditFanoutProcessor` from `audit-fanout.processor.ts`.
 *
 * Queue-name vs job-name
 * ----------------------
 * The BullMQ *queue name* is the transport channel — `"audit"`. A queue
 * may carry multiple *job-name* message types over time. The current
 * (and only) job name is `"audit-fanout"`, validated downstream by
 * `AuditFanoutProcessor.process` (it throws `UnknownAuditJobError` for
 * any other name). This worker forwards `job.name` verbatim and
 * deliberately does NOT pin the job-name string here — that pin lives
 * in `audit-fanout.processor.ts` and its spec.
 *
 * Why a `WorkerFactory` instead of constructing `new Worker(...)` here?
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   - Tests can inject a `FakeWorkerFactory` and capture the registered
 *     handler + options without booting Redis or BullMQ.
 *   - Production wiring (`worker.module.ts`) injects the same
 *     `BullMqWorkerFactory` used by `EmailWorker`. The factory is
 *     queue-name-agnostic — `create(queueName, handler, options)`.
 *   - One repo idiom: same `*Like`-interface pattern PR #14
 *     (`QueueLike`), PR #15 (`RecordingEmailAdapter`), and `EmailWorker`
 *     already use.
 *
 * Lifecycle
 * ---------
 *   - `start()` constructs the underlying worker via the factory,
 *     passing `DEFAULT_WORKER_OPTIONS` from shared, and subscribes to
 *     its `"error"` event for diagnostic logging only.
 *   - `close()` shuts the worker down cleanly (drains in-flight jobs).
 *     Called by Nest's `onModuleDestroy` hook, which `main.ts` triggers
 *     on SIGTERM / SIGINT via `app.close()`.
 *
 * Idempotent: calling `start()` twice or `close()` before `start()` is
 * tolerated; the spec pins both behaviours.
