/**
 * posting-work-item.projection.ts — the 012 work-item WIRE SHAPE (PULL side).
 *
 * The DP2 posting pipeline resolves item/warehouse identity at TWO moments,
 * deliberately split (the 012 contract's idempotent-replay obligation forbids a
 * write side-effect on the GET feed):
 *
 *   1. ELIGIBILITY — at row CREATION. Owned by the worker
 *      `PostingRequestedConsumer.resolveEligibility` (apps/worker): it joins each
 *      line → a CONFIRMED `erpnext_item_map` + the store → `erpnext_warehouse_map`
 *      and inserts a `pending` (resolvable) or `permanently_rejected` row BEFORE
 *      the work-item is offered (rider R2). That logic lives THERE, not here — the
 *      worker cannot import api code, and only one live copy must exist.
 *
 *   2. WIRE ASSEMBLY — at PULL (this file, `buildWorkItem()`). A pure read: it
 *      re-joins an already-`pending` row's sale + frozen lines + confirmed
 *      item-map to populate the 012 `PostingWorkItem` (each line's
 *      `erpnextItemRef`). NO status mutation → re-pulling the same cursor yields
 *      the same logical set (012 idempotent replay).
 *
 * All queries run under the caller's tenant GUC (the caller wraps in
 * `runWithTenantContext`); RLS does the tenant scoping.
