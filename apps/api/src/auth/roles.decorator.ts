/**
 * `@Roles()` / `@RolesFromParam()` / `@PlatformAdminOnly()` — slice US5 (T201).
 *
 * Decorator family that publishes authorization metadata for `RolesGuard`
 * to read via `Reflector`. Three flavors cover the routes this codebase
 * needs:
 *
 *   1. `@Roles("owner", "tenant_admin")`
 *      Tenant context lives on `request.context.tenantId` (the common
 *      case — routes that mount `TenantContextGuard`).
 *
 *   2. `@RolesFromParam("id", "owner", "tenant_admin")`
 *      Path-as-context routes like `PATCH /api/v1/tenants/:id` where
 *      `TenantContextGuard` is intentionally NOT mounted (see
 *      `tenants.service.ts` header). The guard reads tenant id from
 *      `request.params[<key>]` instead.
 *
 *   3. `@PlatformAdminOnly()`
 *      Operations that only platform admins may perform (e.g.
 *      `POST /tenants`, `DELETE /tenants/:id`). Distinguished from the
 *      other two because failure is **403** (not 404) — platform-admin
 *      status is self-knowable via `GET /context/me`, so a forbidden
 *      response leaks no side-channel info.
 *
 * Default-deny posture
 * --------------------
 * `RolesGuard` treats absent metadata as deny (FR-AUTHZ default-deny).
 * Any handler the guard runs against MUST carry one of these decorators
 * or be wrapped in a future `@Public()` annotation. This is enforced by
 * the guard itself; the decorator just publishes the metadata.
