/**
 * operator-context-resolver.ts — 008 Option Y.
 *
 * Reusable POS-operator identity + eligibility resolution. Given a Clerk JWT
 * and a device-token attestation, it runs the SAME derivation the operator
 * sign-in pipeline uses and returns a `ResolvedContext` scoped from the device
 * row + membership — or a typed refusal.
 *
 * This is the shared trust core for the POS sale-sync surface (Option Y,
 * owner-ratified 2026-06-10): the sale endpoints authenticate exactly like
 * `POST /api/pos/v1/operators/sign-in` — Clerk JWT in `Authorization` +
 * device attestation in the body — instead of requiring a server-internal
 * `pos_operator` bearer that sign-in never issues to clients.
 *
 * Derivation (mirrors PosOperatorsService.runPipeline steps 1–5):
 *   1. Verify the provider token at the trust boundary via
 *      `IdentityProviderPort.verifyIdentityToken` → a provider-NEUTRAL verified
 *      subject `{ providerKey, issuer, subject }` (029 D3 / PI-3). The concrete
 *      Clerk verification stays behind the adapter — this resolver never reads a
 *      Clerk-typed claim.
 *   2. Resolve the local user by JOINing the provider-neutral subject onto the
 *      `external_identity_links` ACTIVE link (NOT `users.clerk_user_id = sub` —
 *      029 D3 / G-3); reject if there is no active link (`user_unmapped`) or the
 *      user is soft-deleted (`user_disabled`).
 *   3. Resolve the device by attestation hash (active rows only); the device
 *      row carries the canonical `(tenant_id, store_id)`.
 *   4. Resolve the operator's membership in the device's tenant; role MUST be
 *      one of {owner, tenant_admin, store_manager}; reject revoked / deleted.
 *   5. Store eligibility: `all` → any store in tenant; `specific` → must be in
 *      the access set for the device's store.
 *
 * On success, publishes `(tenant_id, store_id)` FROM the device row (the
 * authority) and `user_id` from the local user — NEVER from any request body
 * (FR-061 mass-assignment ban). Every failure is a typed `refused` reason,
 * logged server-side by the caller and collapsed to a generic 401 at the
 * boundary (no factor disclosure).
 *
 * The provider token and device attestation are never logged, persisted, or
 * returned (FR-POS-AUTH-10 / ADR D3).
 *
 * 029 D3 NOTE: this resolver is the sale-sync identity trust core. It was
 * re-pointed (PI-3) from the direct Clerk verifier + `WHERE clerk_user_id = $1`
 * to the provider-neutral `IdentityProviderPort` + an `external_identity_links`
 * join. The operator/sale-sync CREDENTIAL (the Option Y envelope) and the
 * membership/store/eligibility logic are UNCHANGED — D3 re-anchors only "who the
 * human is" (N-2). The sign-in service path (`pos-operators.service.ts`) is a
 * SEPARATE slice and still joins `clerk_user_id`; after backfill both resolve the
 * same user.
