 * T091 — no-unbounded-batch-path guard (008 WIRING slice).

 * FR-080 / SI-011 mandate: "no path MUST offer an unbounded batch that
 * circumvents the inherited [001/004] rate-limit posture or starves other
 * tenants" — the posture's *existence* is the mandate. The gate-D.2 decision
 * sets an **offline-recovery batch ceiling of 500 sale events/request**, but
 * that numeric ceiling BINDS ONLY WHEN A BULK PATH SHIPS. No bulk/batch path
 * exists today (only single-sale capture + single terminal events), so the
 * correct guard for THIS slice is: assert the sales surface exposes ONLY
 * single-sale routes and rejects an array-shaped (multi-sale) body. The 500/req
 * ceiling is documented here as binding-when-bulk-ships; implementing it is a
 * separate [GATED] OpenAPI decision and is explicitly NOT done here.
 *
 * Pure unit-level: reads the capture DTO schema + the controller source. No
 * HTTP server, no Redis, no Postgres — Docker-free.
