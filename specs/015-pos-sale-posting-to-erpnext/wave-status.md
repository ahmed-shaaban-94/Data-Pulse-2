# Wave Status — `015-pos-sale-posting-to-erpnext`

> Human-readable summary of where the spec stands. 015 is the **keystone** of the
> ERPNext integration arc: it turns a DP2 sale fact (008) into ERPNext accounting
> truth over the fixed 012 pull/feed contract, resolving items via 013. The full
> Spec-Kit planning chain (`plan.md` / `data-model.md` / `tasks.md` /
> `execution-map.yaml`) is MERGED (#500); **MVP implementation is now UNDERWAY** on
> branch `feat/015-pos-sale-posting-mvp` (SIGNOFF → SETUP → [GATED] EVENT-TYPE +
> SCHEMA → ISOLATION-HARNESS → US1-FEED 🎯).

**Last updated:** 2026-06-06 by Ahmed Shaaban — MVP implementation started; the two `[GATED]` `packages/db` slices (015-EVENT-TYPE + 015-SCHEMA) + the new-table decision (015-SIGNOFF-STATE) owner-AUTHORIZED in-session
**Spec:** `015-pos-sale-posting-to-erpnext` (`specs/015-pos-sale-posting-to-erpnext/`)
**Base:** `feat/015-pos-sale-posting-mvp` off `origin/main` (planning chain MERGED via #493 + #500)
**Status:** planning chain MERGED (#493 spec, #500). **MVP (6 slices) MERGED to `main` (#501, `f1f9340`)**: SIGNOFF + SETUP + `[GATED]` EVENT-TYPE + `[GATED]` SCHEMA (0019) + ISOLATION-HARNESS + 🎯 US1-FEED (incl. code-review fixes). **T034 HTTP-edge** (controller + real `ConnectorAuthGuard` + DTO) follows on `feat/015-us1-feed-http-edge`. Remaining 015 surfaces (US2-ACK / US3-REVERSAL / US4-RESOLVE-FAIL / POLISH) after.

### T034 scope correction (the deferred HTTP-edge gap, verified 2026-06-05)
The MVP feed spec drove the *service* directly; T034 adds the real HTTP surface. Investigation shrank T034 to **four real behaviors** — two of the originally-listed paths **do not apply to the pull endpoint** and are documented as out-of-scope, not implemented:
- **`snapshot_required` (409) — NOT implemented (reserved).** 015 does **not** prune `erpnext_posting_status` (dead-letters persist for 017), so every cursor ≤ max is fully servable and a **caught-up cursor returns an empty 200**, never a 409. There is no stale-horizon trigger (unlike 010, which prunes its change-log). Reserved for a future retention model (017). The only correct future trigger would be `since > max` (feed-reset recovery) — exotic, no connector consumer exists yet, deliberately not built.
- **non-disclosing 404 — NOT on the pull.** `connectorPullPostings` has no `workItemRef` path param and the cursor is a bare global `sequence` bigint (no embedded scope); RLS scopes the rows, so there is no foreign-ref to reject. The `not_found` path belongs to `connectorAckOutcome` (US2-ACK).
- **Tested (T034):** 401 unauthenticated + wrong-scope (dashboard_api/pos/pos_operator REJECTED, only `connector` accepted — the 012 connectorBearer machine gate, proven through the REAL guard + real `auth_tokens`); 400 strict DTO (bad `since` / over-range `limit` / unknown key); 200 happy path; 200 empty on a caught-up cursor.

### MVP build results (WSL Testcontainers)
- `[GATED]` SCHEMA (0019 `erpnext_posting_status`): migration round-trip **16/16**, migrate allowlist **10/10**, schema-shape **11/11**. O-3 unique keyed on the collision-proof `source_ref_id` (NOT `source_system/external_id` — the REVERSAL-CARDINALITY fix, so multiple partial refunds per sale each post).
- `[GATED]` EVENT-TYPE (`erpnext.posting.requested`): registry **5/5**.
- ISOLATION-HARNESS: RLS sweep **8/8**.
- 🎯 US1-FEED: **two-moment 015-RESOLVE split** (eligibility at row CREATION in the worker `PostingRequestedConsumer` → `pending`/`permanently_rejected`; wire assembly at PULL is a pure read → 012 idempotent replay holds). Consumer spec **5/5** (resolvable→pending, ad-hoc→`unmapped_item`, no-warehouse→`unmapped_store`, idempotent re-run via `ON CONFLICT`, sale-fact-untouched). Feed spec **5/5** (resolved `erpnextItemRef`, posted-excluded, exact-decimal money + `businessDate`, cursor ordering + replay, limit cap). Auth = a new `connector` bearer scope + `ConnectorAuthGuard` (type-only, no migration — `auth_tokens.scope` is free text). The posting trigger emits `erpnext.posting.requested` in-transaction from the 008 `SaleProcessingProcessor` when a sale first becomes processed (cross-slice edit; 008 regression **7/7** GREEN after fixing the UUID-typed `correlation_id`). Consumer wired into the drainer registry via the WorkerModule `drainerProcessorProviderFactory` (race-free: before the runner's `onModuleInit` start).
**Active finding(s):** REVERSAL-CARDINALITY (resolved — O-3 unique keyed on the originating row's own pair, data-model §5); inherits 013 `AUTO_MATCH_NO_SOURCE` → v1 manual-only.

## SIGN-OFF Decisions (015-SIGNOFF, T001–T003 — recorded 2026-06-06)

### T001 — `015-SIGNOFF-STATE`: a new `[GATED]` `erpnext_posting_status` table (NOT derive-on-read)

**Decision: a new `[GATED]` state table.** 015 records, per DP2 sale (and per void/refund terminal event), the state of its ERPNext posting — `pending` → `posted` / `failed_transient` / `permanently_rejected` — plus the ERPNext `documentRef`. Derive-on-read is **infeasible**: the 008 sale fact (`0012`) carries no posting columns and must stay immutable (the 012 contract: *"the sale fact is NEVER mutated by an outcome — only its posting status is recorded"*), and an externally-assigned ERPNext `documentRef` **cannot be derived** — so O-3 (exactly-one document per sale) is unenforceable without persisted state. The 010 read-down feed set the precedent (a `[GATED]` `0015` change-log table; the app/outbox-mirror alternative was rejected) for a *weaker* need. **Owner-authorized in-session 2026-06-06.** Full rationale: [data-model.md §2](./data-model.md#2-the-load-bearing-decision--state-table-vs-derive-on-read).

### T002 — interim Sales-Invoice-only / outstanding-AR mode (rider R1)

015 posts a **submitted Sales Invoice only** (with stock impact) — **no Payment Entry / tender** state or payload. This interim mode is **gated** and **not finance-complete**: expect **unpaid/outstanding** ERPNext invoices (open AR) until the Payment Entry arc ships (DP2 tender model → 012 payment extension → connector PE → payment repair). Deriving a PE from `posTotal` is **STOP-and-raise** (not ratified). The signed target (SI + associated PE) is unchanged, not replaced. [spec §5.2 / rider R1].

### T003 — DLQ / `permanently_rejected` state only; the reconciliation run is 017

015 **produces** the `permanently_rejected` rows + reconciliation flags; the **DLQ drain + reconciliation run + repair API is 017** (a separate Spec-Kit chain, not yet specced). 015 adds no scheduled job, no repair endpoint, no ERPNext-Bin fetch. [spec §8, §10.4].

---

## TL;DR

015 implements **exactly** the two SIGNED 011 decision records:

- **Posting** (011-DR-POSTING): one **submitted Sales Invoice per DP2 sale**
  (1:1), async via outbox + connector pull, `businessDate`-driven posting date,
  idempotent on `sourceSystem + externalId` + payload hash, void/refund as a
  **new reversing document**, retry → DLQ + reconciliation (DP2 fact never
  mutated). **The signed target remains Sales Invoice + associated Payment
  Entry**; the first implementation slice runs the **owner-ratified interim
  mode** (invoice-only / outstanding AR — **gated, not finance-complete**;
  rider R1).
- **Stock impact** (011-DR-STOCK-IMPACT): the Sales Invoice posts with **"Update
  Stock" ON**, correlated by the sale's `sourceSystem + externalId`, **never**
  double-counted against the DP2 009 operational ledger.

Transport: the **fixed 012 `posting-feed.yaml`** (consumed as-is — work-items
out via `connectorPullPostings`, outcomes back via `connectorAckOutcome`;
satisfies O-1..O-7). Item identity: **015-RESOLVE** (the 013 deferral) — lazy
posting-time resolution against **confirmed** `erpnext_item_map` rows;
unmapped → fails-to-DLQ.

DP2 makes **no outbound HTTP calls**; the connector posting adapter (G8 boundary)
is the only ERPNext-calling component, behind the 012 contract (ADR 0008).

## Decisions RATIFIED ([owner rider 011-DR-POSTING-R1, SIGNED 2026-06-05](../011-erpnext-pos-reference-and-integration-foundation/decisions/posting-decision-rider-2026-06-05.md))

| ID | Ratified decision | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **OQ-7 / Payment Entry (rider R1)** | **Signed target unchanged: Sales Invoice + associated Payment Entry per sale.** First implementation slice runs the **owner-ratified interim mode** — submitted Sales Invoice / **outstanding AR only** — explicitly **gated** and **not finance-complete** (expect unpaid/outstanding ERPNext invoices until the tender/payment extension ships). Payment Entry requires: DP2 tender model → 012 payment extension → connector idempotent PE creation → payment repair semantics. Deriving a PE from `posTotal` is **not ratified**. | spec §5.2, §11 |
| **OQ-5 (rider R3)** | Disabled / non-sales ERPNext Item at posting time → **fails-to-DLQ; no silent fallback, no substitute item**; **operational sellability stays DP2-authoritative**. Divergence = reconciliation case (017), never a silent override. | resolution-concepts §5 |
| **OQ-6 (rider R4)** | Inbound unknown-items and outbound unmapped-for-posting are **separate operational states**; resolving an unknown item creates a `tenant_product` that **still needs a confirmed 013 mapping** before it can post. 015 never routes posting failures into the unknown-items queue. | resolution-concepts §6 |
| **OQ-8 (rider R5)** | DP-014 not built → absent a resolved warehouse, **fail-to-DLQ (`unmapped_store`-class)** — **never guess the ERPNext warehouse**. | spec §10.1 |
| **OQ-8-bis (rider R2)** | **DP2 resolves line→Item at projection** (O-1 self-sufficiency); failed resolution → DLQ in DP2 **before** the work-item is offered. Connector **MUST NOT** guess Item identity, reach back into DP2, or hold a second mapping copy. Implementation **GATED on the 012 correction/extension** (`SaleLine.erpnextItemRef` or equivalent + `tenantProductRef` description correction) — **required before 015 implementation**. | resolution-concepts §7 |

## Next recommended action

015's spec is authored (planning lane complete). **Prerequisites 1–3 below are
now SATISFIED on `main` (verified 2026-06-05)** — the next live work is the
`erpnext.posting.requested` event-type (4) and then 015's own Spec-Kit chain (5).
The implementation arc, in order:

1. ~~**P-DP-008-LIVELOOP**~~ — ✅ **DONE** (#496 + #497): processed sales are now
   feedable end-to-end (rider R6 honored — it shipped as its own `specs/008`
   slice, never absorbed into 015).
2. ~~**014-CRUD**~~ — ✅ **DONE** (#495): the store→warehouse map (`erpnext_warehouse_map`
   + `0018` migration) is on `main`.
3. ~~**`[GATED]` 012 contract correction**~~ — ✅ **DONE** (#494): `SaleLine.erpnextItemRef`
   is now `required` in `posting-feed.yaml` (DP2-side resolution; rider R2 satisfied).
4. **`[GATED]` `erpnext.posting.requested` event-type registration** — ⏳ **NEXT
   GATED STEP.** Not yet in `OUTBOX_EVENT_TYPES` (git-verified). Scope it as a
   `[GATED]` `packages/db` slice (T541-style approval), ideally within 015's plan.
5. **015's own Spec-Kit chain** (`plan.md` → Constitution Check → `[GATED]`
   schema/contract as needed → `tasks.md` → `execution-map.yaml`), then the
   posting feed + worker + `015-RESOLVE` — in the **interim
   invoice-only/outstanding-AR mode** (rider R1). ← **the recommended next action
   for 015 itself** (`/speckit-plan`); steps 1–3 no longer block it.
6. **016** tax/fiscal; **017** DLQ drain + reconciliation + repair.
7. *(Later, separately gated — rider R1)*: tender model → 012 payment extension
   → connector idempotent Payment Entry → payment repair semantics →
   **Payment Entry posting** (completing the signed target).

## Closeout note (docs-only)

No application code, DB schema/migration, OpenAPI YAML (incl. `posting-feed.yaml`),
`package.json`/lockfile, CI, connector, POS, or Console file changed. **No runtime
behavior changed.** This slice adds the 015 planning spec + companions under
`specs/015-pos-sale-posting-to-erpnext/` **plus the durable owner-decision rider**
`specs/011-erpnext-pos-reference-and-integration-foundation/decisions/posting-decision-rider-2026-06-05.md`
— nothing else. **Merged to `main` via PR #493** (`1faea76`).
