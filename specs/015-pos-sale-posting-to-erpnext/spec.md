# Feature Specification: POS Sale Posting to ERPNext

**Feature ID**: 015
**Short name**: pos-sale-posting-to-erpnext
**Status**: Draft — planning / docs-only (no implementation)
**Created**: 2026-06-05
**Owner**: Ahmed Shaaban
**Constitution version**: 3.0.1

---

## 0. What this spec is (and is not)

This is the **planning spec** for 015 — the **keystone** of the ERPNext
integration arc (011 foundation + signed decisions → 012 connector contracts →
013 product master → 014 warehouse mapping → **015 sale posting**). It turns a
Data-Pulse-2 sale fact (008) into ERPNext accounting truth over the fixed 012
pull/feed contract.

It is **docs / planning only**: no application code, no DB schema, no migration,
no OpenAPI YAML, no `package.json`/lockfile, no CI, no connector code. No runtime
behavior changes.

Like 011, 012, and 013's spec PR, this spec carries **no `plan.md`,
`tasks.md`, `data-model.md`, or `execution-map.yaml`** and **no dispatchable code
slices**. It establishes purpose, the posting model, the transport realisation,
the posting-time item resolution (015-RESOLVE), idempotency/temporal/money
design, the implementation gates it inherits but does not satisfy, the failure
posture, and the open questions (now **RATIFIED** — see §11). **Implementation stays blocked** until 015 runs
its own Spec-Kit chain (`plan.md` → Constitution Check → any `[GATED]`
contract/schema → `tasks.md` → `execution-map.yaml`) and the Agent OS gates clear.

Companion documents in this folder:

- [resolution-concepts.md](./resolution-concepts.md) — 015-RESOLVE (the 013
  posting-time resolution deferral) + the **ratified** OQ-5/OQ-6/OQ-8-bis resolutions.
- [follow-up-notes.md](./follow-up-notes.md) — the inherited implementation gates
  (DP-014, P-DP-008-LIVELOOP, G3/G7/G8), the `[GATED]` follow-ups (the
  `erpnext.posting.requested` event-type registration, any future contract
  extensions), and forward references.
- [wave-status.md](./wave-status.md) — human-readable state.

## 1. Background & Why

The signed **posting decision**
([011-DR-POSTING](../011-erpnext-pos-reference-and-integration-foundation/decisions/posting-decision-record.md))
and the signed **stock-impact decision**
([011-DR-STOCK-IMPACT](../011-erpnext-pos-reference-and-integration-foundation/decisions/stock-impact-decision-record.md))
both name **015** as the slice that *implements exactly this*: async
Sales-Invoice posting with the reconciliation/repair path, posting the Sales
Invoice with "Update Stock" ON, tagged with the correlation ID.

The **owner-decision rider**
([011-DR-POSTING-R1, SIGNED 2026-06-05](../011-erpnext-pos-reference-and-integration-foundation/decisions/posting-decision-rider-2026-06-05.md))
**ratifies** this spec's open questions: the interim Payment Entry mode (R1 /
OQ-7), DP2-side item resolution (R2 / OQ-8-bis), and the fail-to-DLQ postures
(R3–R5 / OQ-5, OQ-6, OQ-8), and re-affirms that `P-DP-008-LIVELOOP` is not
absorbed (R6). **The rider — not this spec — is the durable owner-decision
artifact; this spec defers to it.**

The [011 follow-up-spec-map](../011-erpnext-pos-reference-and-integration-foundation/follow-up-spec-map.md)
frames 015 as **the keystone of the ERPNext arc** — *"turns the DP2 sale fact
into ERPNext accounting + stock truth. Needs items (013) and stock model (014)
settled."*

The transport already exists: the **012 posting-feed contract**
(`packages/contracts/openapi/erpnext-connector/posting-feed.yaml`, `1.0.0-draft`,
on `main`) ships a **pull/feed bidirectional** surface — the connector PULLS
pending posting work-items (`connectorPullPostings`) and ACKs outcomes back
(`connectorAckOutcome`). 015 **consumes this contract as fixed**; it does not
redesign it.

The item identity already exists: **013** shipped the `erpnext_item_map` MVP
(suggest-then-confirm, confirmed-only resolution; `0017` migration on `main`),
but explicitly **deferred the posting-time resolution path (`013-RESOLVE`) and
its OQ-5/OQ-6 to 015**. 015 defines that resolution here.

What is **not** yet built and 015 must sequence around: **DP-014** has authored
only its planning chain (its `[GATED]` SCHEMA/CONTRACT slices remain `proposed`),
and the **008 live capture→process loop is GATED** (`P-DP-008-LIVELOOP`). 015
defines its expectations on these without absorbing them (see §9, §10).

---

## 2. Purpose

Define, at the planning level:

- The **posting model**: how a DP2 sale fact (008) becomes ERPNext accounting
  truth — one submitted Sales Invoice per sale, the Payment Entry posture, stock
  impact, and void/refund reversal — **per both SIGNED decision records, exactly**.
- The **transport realisation**: how the posting path uses the fixed 012
  pull/feed contract (work-items out, outcomes back) and satisfies the seven 012
  contract obligations (O-1..O-7).
- **Item identity at posting time** (`015-RESOLVE`): how each sale line resolves
  to a confirmed ERPNext Item via the 013 `erpnext_item_map`, and what happens
  when it does not (fails-to-DLQ).
- The **idempotency, temporal, and money** design the implementation must satisfy.
- The **implementation gates 015 inherits but does not satisfy** in this
  planning lane (DP-014 warehouse mapping, P-DP-008-LIVELOOP, G3/G5/G7/G8).
- The **failure posture** (DLQ + reconciliation, no silent rewrite).
- The **open questions** — now **RATIFIED** by the
  [2026-06-05 owner rider](../011-erpnext-pos-reference-and-integration-foundation/decisions/posting-decision-rider-2026-06-05.md) (§11).

---

## 3. Non-Goals

This feature is **planning / docs only**. It explicitly does **not**:

- Author **OpenAPI YAML** under `packages/contracts/openapi/**` — including any
  edit to the fixed `erpnext-connector/posting-feed.yaml` (read-only input). If
  015 identifies a needed contract change, it is recorded as a **future
  `[GATED]` 012 slice** — proposed, or **required pre-implementation** in the
  case of the rider-R2 item-resolution correction
  ([follow-up-notes.md](./follow-up-notes.md)) — never authored here.
- Author any **DB schema, Drizzle schema, or SQL migration** (`packages/db/**`).
  Any work-item / DLQ / posting-status state 015 introduces is a separate
  `[GATED]` slice (§VIII), flagged in [follow-up-notes.md](./follow-up-notes.md).
- **Register** the `erpnext.posting.requested` outbox event type — a separate
  `[GATED]` approval PR (named, not registered, by 012/013).
- Build or modify any **application code** (NestJS modules, services,
  controllers, workers) — in DP2 **or** in the (future) connector repo.
- **Build the connector.** The connector posting adapter lives in the future
  `Retail-Tower-ERP-Next-Connector` repo (ADR 0008), behind the 012 contract.
- Touch any file under **`specs/008-sales-transaction-capture/**`**. The live
  capture→process loop (`P-DP-008-LIVELOOP`) is owned there and is **excluded
  from this spec** by owner decision 2026-06-05 — named as a prerequisite only
  (§10.2).
- Author **DP-014** content — warehouse mapping is 014's slice (§10.1).
- Modify **`package.json` / lockfiles / CI**.
- Change **runtime behavior** of any kind.

## 4. Actors

| Actor | Role in 015's domain |
|---|---|
| **Data-Pulse-2 (backend)** | Source of truth for the sale fact (008, §IX). **Exposes** the 012 pull feed of pending posting work-items and **ingests** outcomes; owns the resulting DLQ + reconciliation state (017 surfaces it). Resolves each sale line to a confirmed ERPNext Item via 013 `erpnext_item_map`. Makes **no outbound HTTP calls**; holds **no** ERPNext credentials. |
| **Retail-Tower-ERP-Next-Connector** *(future repo)* | The **only** component that posts to ERPNext. Pulls work-items, posts a submitted Sales Invoice (Update Stock ON) / reversing document, ACKs the outcome (ERPNext document ref + outcome). Holds **all** ERPNext credentials. The **G8 upgrade-gate boundary** lands here (the only ERPNext-version-aware component). |
| **ERPNext / Frappe** | The pinned ERP the connector posts into. Owns the GL and inventory valuation. Not a direct actor on the DP2 ↔ connector contract. |
| **Tenant Admin** | Confirms `erpnext_item_map` mappings (013) so sale lines are resolvable; repairs unmapped/disabled-item reconciliation cases surfaced by a failed posting (017). |
| **POS Device / POS Operator** | **Unaware of ERPNext.** Captures the sale (008) on `/api/pos/v1/…`; never participates in posting. |
| **Owner / Architect** | **Has ratified** the open-question resolutions (§11) and the interim Payment Entry mode (§5.2) via the [2026-06-05 rider](../011-erpnext-pos-reference-and-integration-foundation/decisions/posting-decision-rider-2026-06-05.md); approves each `[GATED]` follow-up. |

Cross-tenant isolation, non-disclosing errors (404-class), and audit obligations
on the feed follow the posture the 012 contract and the 010 read-down API
established (§II/§XII).

## 5. The posting model (per both SIGNED decision records)

> Every normative statement below cites the decision-record clause it
> implements. Any deviation from a SIGNED record is a **STOP-and-raise**
> condition, not a silent override (the records say so themselves). §5.2's
> interim Payment Entry mode is **owner-ratified**
> ([rider R1, 2026-06-05](../011-erpnext-pos-reference-and-integration-foundation/decisions/posting-decision-rider-2026-06-05.md))
> — handled on the record, not silently.

### 5.1 One submitted Sales Invoice per DP2 sale (1:1)

Each DP2 sale (008 `sales` + `sale_lines`) posts as **exactly one submitted
ERPNext Sales Invoice** [posting §1]. There is:

- **No POS Invoice + POS Closing consolidation** [posting §1].
- **No draft-then-submit two-phase flow** — the invoice is **submitted**
  [posting §1].
- A 1:1 sale ↔ document mapping for the cleanest reconciliation [posting §1].

### 5.2 Payment Entry — OWNER-RATIFIED INTERIM MODE ([rider R1, 2026-06-05](../011-erpnext-pos-reference-and-integration-foundation/decisions/posting-decision-rider-2026-06-05.md))

**The signed target is unchanged**: posting decision §1 names *"one submitted
Sales Invoice + the associated **Payment Entry**"* per DP2 sale — and that
**remains the accepted posting model**. This spec does **not** replace it;
"Sales Invoice only" is **not** the final posting model.

The constraint is upstream and physical: **008 models no tender** (gate A.5; the
008 `sales` row has no tender/payment fields, confirmed in 008 data-model), and
the **current 012 posting-feed work-item cannot carry tender/payment payload**:

> *PAYMENT ENTRY DEFERRAL: the posting decision pairs the Sales Invoice with "its
> associated Payment Entry", but 008 models NO tender (gate A.5 — payments
> deferred). The work-item therefore carries the sale only and CANNOT carry
> tender; the connector posts the Sales Invoice (+ stock impact per 014) — the
> Payment Entry is deferred until a DP2 payments model lands, at which point the
> work-item payload + this contract gain the tender fields (a versioned,
> backward-compatible extension). `posTotal` is the sale total, not tender.*
> — `posting-feed.yaml` (on `main`)

**Owner-ratified interim mode (rider R1) — "submitted Sales Invoice / outstanding AR only":**

- The **first implementation slice posts the submitted Sales Invoice only** (with
  stock impact, §5.3). This interim mode is explicitly labelled:
  - **NOT finance-complete production posting** — a temporary,
    finance-incomplete state, never the destination;
  - **expected to produce unpaid/outstanding ERPNext Sales Invoices** (open AR)
    until the tender/payment extension ships — by design, not a defect; any
    consumer of ERPNext finance reports must be told this is the expected state;
  - **gated**: Payment Entry posting MUST NOT be implemented before the gated
    extension work below.
- **Payment Entry requires ALL of this future gated work** (rider R1; recorded in
  [follow-up-notes.md](./follow-up-notes.md)):
  1. a DP2 **tender/payment fact model** (or approved equivalent sale-payment payload);
  2. a **012 posting-feed extension** for payment/tender data (versioned,
     backward-compatible);
  3. **connector support for idempotent Payment Entry creation**;
  4. **repair/reconciliation semantics for payment posting** (017 boundary).

> **STOP-and-raise note (per rider R1).** Implementing Payment Entry posting
> before the four gated items land — including deriving a v1 Payment Entry from
> `posTotal` (unallocated/on-account), which the rider explicitly does **not**
> ratify — is a STOP-and-raise, never something 015 authors silently.
> Ratification record: **OQ-7, RATIFIED** (§11).

### 5.3 Stock impact — "Update Stock" ON, correlated, never double-counted

The submitted Sales Invoice posts with **"Update Stock" ON** [stock-impact §3]
so ERPNext derives **valuation / COGS / GL** from it. This is **ERPNext's own
accounting ledger**, not a second operational count:

- DP2's 009 ledger independently records the operational outbound movement
  (009 US4) — the two ledgers answer **different questions** (operational
  available-to-sell vs accounting valuation) and are **never summed**
  [stock-impact §3].
- They are **correlated by the shared correlation ID** — the DP2 sale's
  `sourceSystem + externalId` [stock-impact §3, posting §3] — and **reconciled,
  not merged** (the reconciliation run is 017 [stock-impact §5]).
- A **separate Stock Entry per sale ("Update Stock" OFF) is rejected** for v1
  [stock-impact §3].
- The stock posts against an ERPNext **Warehouse mapped 1:1** to the DP2
  store/branch by **014** [stock-impact §4]. 015 depends on that mapping; the
  minimal-v1 path when 014 has not shipped is in §10.1 + [follow-up-notes.md](./follow-up-notes.md).
- **Negative-balance posture** [stock-impact §6]. DP2's 009 ledger
  **allows-and-flags** negative balances (operational reality: stock can be sold
  before a restock is recorded); ERPNext stock validation **may reject** negative
  stock. This mismatch is **expected** and handled by the failure posture (§8): a
  negative-stock rejection is a `permanently_rejected` (`validation`-class)
  outcome → DLQ + reconciliation flag (017). The DP2 flagged operational reality
  is **never** overwritten to satisfy ERPNext [stock-impact §6].

### 5.4 Void / refund — a new reversing document, never an edit of the original

A DP2 008 terminal event (void or refund) posts as a **new reversing document**
— a **credit note / return Sales Invoice** referencing the original — and
**never** cancels/amends/edits the original submitted invoice [posting §6]. The
012 contract realises this as a **`reversal` work-item** carrying the original's
provenance (`reversalOf`) so the connector locates the document to reverse
[posting §6, 012 O-4, posting-feed.yaml `kind: reversal`]. Both the original sale
and its reversal remain as audit truth (append-only, §IX/§X).

### 5.5 System of record — DP2 owns the sale fact; ERPNext owns the GL

DP2 remains source of truth for the sale fact [posting §4, §IX]. ERPNext owns the
**General Ledger entries** the submitted Sales Invoice produces [posting §4]. The
connector **MUST NOT** silently rewrite a posted ERPNext document; DP2 **MUST
NOT** silently rewrite POS-received sale totals (§III); posted amounts reconcile
to the DP2 sale totals [posting §4].

---

## 6. Transport — realising the fixed 012 pull/feed contract

015 implements the **DP2 side** of the 012 contract; the connector side lives in
the connector repo. DP2 makes **no outbound HTTP calls** — it exposes the feed
the connector pulls and ingests the outcome the connector acks [012 transport].

### 6.1 The two halves (consumed as fixed)

| Half | 012 operation | 015's DP2-side obligation |
|---|---|---|
| **Work-items out** | `connectorPullPostings` (`GET /api/connector/v1/erpnext/postings`) | Project each pending posting (sale post + void/refund reversal) into a **self-sufficient** `PostingWorkItem`; serve the cursor-paginated, ordered, gap-detectable feed (mirrors 010 read-down delta). |
| **Outcomes back** | `connectorAckOutcome` (`POST /…/{workItemRef}/outcome`) | Ingest the outcome (`posted` / `failed_transient` / `permanently_rejected`); record the ERPNext `documentRef`; own the DLQ + reconciliation state. Idempotent ack (O-3). |

### 6.2 The seven contract obligations (O-1..O-7) — how 015 satisfies them

| Obligation | How 015 satisfies it |
|---|---|
| **O-1 — Work-item payload self-sufficiency** | The work-item carries the full 008 sale projection (header + frozen lines), `sourceSystem`/`externalId`/`payloadHash` provenance, `businessDate`, store scope, and exact-decimal money — so the connector posts **without** reaching back into DP2. 015 builds this projection from the **processed** 008 sale fact (the `P-DP-008-LIVELOOP` expectation, §10.2). Line→ERPNext-Item resolution is **DP2-side at projection** ([rider R2](../011-erpnext-pos-reference-and-integration-foundation/decisions/posting-decision-rider-2026-06-05.md) — §7); the work-item is therefore self-sufficient for item identity **only once the `[GATED]` 012 correction/extension lands** (`SaleLine.erpnextItemRef` or equivalent — **required before 015 implementation**, §13); see §7 for the unmapped-line failure. |
| **O-2 — Outcome return payload** | 015 ingests `outcome` + `documentRef` + nullable `etaStatus` + structured `reason` (on `permanently_rejected`); a work-item is **not complete** until DP2 records its outcome. |
| **O-3 — Wire idempotency** | Re-pulling/re-posting the same work-item (`sourceSystem + externalId`) resolves to the **same** ERPNext document; the ack echoes the existing `documentRef` on a duplicate `posted`. See §8. |
| **O-4 — Reversal operations** | Void/refund → a `reversal` work-item posting a **new** reversing document referencing the original via `reversalOf` (§5.4). |
| **O-5 — Connector lifecycle & auth** | Consumed as fixed: the connector authenticates as an opaque-revocable, tenant-scoped **service bearer** (`connectorBearer`); cross-tenant isolation + non-disclosing errors hold on the feed. 015 does not redesign auth. |
| **O-6 — Version-independence** | The work-item speaks **DP2/Retail-Tower terms** (sale, line, businessDate, outcome, documentRef), never ERPNext doctype field names. The ERPNext-version concern is the connector's (G8, §10.4). |
| **O-7 — Connector split** | Consumed as fixed (ADR 0008 accepted). 015 builds nothing in the connector repo. |

### 6.3 The posting trigger (DP2 side, design — not built here)

A processed 008 sale (and each void/refund terminal event) becomes a **pending
posting work-item** exposed on the feed. The mechanism is the
`erpnext.posting.requested` outbox event type — **named** by 012/013, **not yet
registered**; registering it is a separate **`[GATED]` `packages/db`** approval
slice ([follow-up-notes.md](./follow-up-notes.md)). 015 designs *what the
work-item carries* (O-1); it does not register the event type or author the feed
endpoint in this planning lane.

---

## 7. Item identity at posting time — 015-RESOLVE (the 013 deferral)

013 shipped the `erpnext_item_map` MVP and **deferred the posting-time resolution
path to 015**. 015 defines it here as **015-RESOLVE**. Full treatment in
[resolution-concepts.md](./resolution-concepts.md); the normative summary:

- **Resolution is lazy, at posting time, DP2-side at work-item projection**
  (013 OQ-8; resolution side **RATIFIED DP2-side** by
  [rider R2, 2026-06-05](../011-erpnext-pos-reference-and-integration-foundation/decisions/posting-decision-rider-2026-06-05.md)
  — connector-side resolution is rejected): when 015 projects a sale into a
  work-item, each sale line's
  `tenantProductRef` resolves to a **confirmed** `erpnext_item_map` row
  (`state = 'confirmed' AND retired_at IS NULL`) [013 data-model §3 confirmed-only
  invariant].
- A **`suggested` (unconfirmed) mapping does NOT count as mapped** — it is
  treated as unmapped [013 data-model §3].
- An **unmapped line → the posting fails-to-DLQ** [posting §1, §5; 013 "fails-to-DLQ
  if not"], surfacing a reconciliation flag (017) with the nearest 012
  `RejectionReason.category = unmapped_item`. The DP2 sale fact is **never**
  mutated on a posting failure [posting §5].
- **v1 mapping suggestion is manual-only** (013 `suggestion_source = 'manual'`;
  finding `AUTO_MATCH_NO_SOURCE`). Auto-match (barcode/item-code) needs a future
  `[GATED]` 012 item-search extension — **named, not authored** here
  ([follow-up-notes.md](./follow-up-notes.md)).
- **Ad-hoc sale lines** (008 FR-004: a line with no `tenantProductRef`) cannot
  resolve to a mapping → same fails-to-DLQ posture (an ad-hoc line has no tenant
  product to map). This is a reconciliation case, not a silent drop.

The two previously-open 013 questions this slice owns — **OQ-5** (disabled
ERPNext Item) and **OQ-6** (relationship to the inbound unknown-items queue) —
are **RATIFIED** by the 2026-06-05 owner rider (R3/R4); the ratified resolutions
are detailed in [resolution-concepts.md](./resolution-concepts.md) (§11).

---

## 8. Idempotency (G5 design) — exactly-one ERPNext document per sale

015 must guarantee **exactly-one** ERPNext document per DP2 sale across retries
[posting §3, 012 O-3, §XI]:

- The dedup anchor is the DP2 sale's **`sourceSystem + externalId`** carried as a
  stable external reference into the posting, **plus a canonical `payloadHash`**
  for provenance [posting §3, 012 O-1].
- Re-pulling/re-posting the same work-item resolves to the **same** ERPNext
  document; the `connectorAckOutcome` ack **echoes the existing `documentRef`**
  on a duplicate `posted` rather than creating a second [012 O-3, posting-feed.yaml].
- The outcome ack reuses the existing `IdempotencyInterceptor`
  (`Idempotency-Key` required); re-acking the **same** logical outcome replays
  deterministically (200), a **different** outcome for the same key is a 409
  `idempotency_key_conflict` [posting-feed.yaml]. **No new idempotency primitive.**

### Re-post / repair semantics (the 017 boundary)

- A `failed_transient` outcome re-offers the work-item on the next pull, bounded
  by a retry budget [posting §5, posting-feed.yaml]. **No** new document is
  created on a transient retry (O-3 holds).
- A `permanently_rejected` outcome dead-letters the work-item + raises a
  **reconciliation flag** [posting §5]. The **DLQ drain + repair surface is
  017** [posting §5, follow-up-spec-map §017] — 015 owns producing the DLQ +
  reconciliation **state**; 017 owns draining/repairing it. A repair re-post must
  resolve to the same document (idempotency holds across repair) — never a silent
  rewrite of an already-posted document [posting §4, §5].

---

## 9. Temporal & money

- **Temporal (§X).** The ERPNext `posting_date` is driven by the sale's
  **`businessDate`** (008, derived from store timezone), **not** the connector's
  post-time [posting §2, 012 O-1, posting-feed.yaml]. A delayed/offline-synced
  sale therefore lands in the **correct fiscal period** [posting §2, §X]. Security
  clocks remain server clocks; the outcome `recordedAt` is the DP2 server clock
  [§X, posting-feed.yaml]. `occurredAt` / `sourceClockAt` are carried/preserved,
  never used as a security clock [§X].
- **Money (§III).** Every monetary field is an **exact-decimal string + ISO-4217
  currency** end-to-end — **no floats** [§III, 012 O-1, posting-feed.yaml
  `DecimalAmount`]. **DP2 amounts are authoritative for the posted invoice** —
  POS totals preserved as received [posting §4, §III, §IX; 013 mapping-concepts
  §4]. The ERPNext Price List reference (013) exists for ERPNext document
  validity, **not** to reprice a DP2 sale [013 mapping-concepts §4]. Whether the
  posting sends explicit per-line amounts vs relies on a Price List is the §IX-safe
  default of **explicit DP2 amounts** [013 mapping-concepts §4 / OQ-4 resolved
  "no pricing on the map table"].

---

## 10. Implementation gates 015 inherits but does NOT satisfy

This is a **planning lane**. 015 **defines** how the implementation will satisfy
these gates; it does not satisfy them here. Full detail in
[follow-up-notes.md](./follow-up-notes.md).

### 10.1 DP-014 warehouse mapping — the "Update Stock ON" target (depends-on)

The stock-impact decision §3/§4 requires the Sales Invoice to post with "Update
Stock" ON against an ERPNext **Warehouse mapped 1:1 to the DP2 store** by
**DP-014**. **DP-014 has authored only its planning chain** — its `[GATED]`
SCHEMA/CONTRACT slices are `proposed`, **not built** (no `erpnext_warehouse_map`
table on `main`; git-verified). Therefore:

- 015's stock-on posting **depends on 014-CRUD shipping the store→warehouse
  map**.
- **Minimal v1 path (RATIFIED — rider R5, 2026-06-05):** absent a resolved
  warehouse for a sale's store, the posting **fails-to-DLQ** (an
  `unmapped_store`-class reconciliation case — aligning with 014's locked
  mismatch vocabulary) — it **does NOT guess a default warehouse**. This keeps
  the operational-vs-accounting split intact (stock-impact §4) and surfaces the
  gap for repair (017) rather than silently mis-valuing stock.
- 015 authors **no** 014 content (warehouse mapping is 014's slice).

### 10.2 P-DP-008-LIVELOOP — prerequisite only (OWNER DECISION 2026-06-05, NOT absorbed)

The 008 **live capture→process loop is GATED** and not yet functional (008
wave-status Active finding #1). **Owner decision (2026-06-05): it is NOT absorbed
into 015.** It remains a **separate implementation/e2e prerequisite slice scoped
under `specs/008-sales-transaction-capture/**`**. This spec:

- **(a) Names it as a prerequisite** in the dependency/sequencing section (§13).
- **(b) Defines the EXPECTATIONS the posting path places on it** — without
  restating its tasks or design:
  - 015 posts **processed** sale facts. The posting path expects that captured
    sales become **processed** (`processed_at` set off-request) and thereby
    eligible to feed work-items. Until the live loop runs, `processed_at` stays
    NULL and **no sale is eligible for posting** — the posting feed is correctly
    empty, not erroring.
  - `processed_at` semantics: a non-NULL `processed_at` is the signal that a sale
    fact has completed DP2-side processing and may be projected into a posting
    work-item. (015 does not define *how* `processed_at` is set — that is the
    008 slice.)
- **(c) Places it in the implementation order** (§13): `P-DP-008-LIVELOOP` must
  ship **before** 015's posting feed can carry real work-items end-to-end.
- This spec **MUST NOT** author, scope, or restate the live-loop's tasks,
  requirements, or design (producer binding / `sale.captured` event type /
  `main.ts` start). Those belong to `specs/008` and are out of scope here.

### 10.3 G3 — schema gate (if 015 introduces state tables)

If 015's implementation introduces **work-item / DLQ / posting-status state**
beyond what `0012`/`0017` already provide, that is a new `packages/db` surface —
a **`[GATED]` G3 schema slice** (Drizzle schema + migration + paired `*.down.sql`,
RLS, tenant-scoping per §II). **Flagged `[GATED]`; not designed here.** See
[follow-up-notes.md](./follow-up-notes.md).

### 10.4 G7 / G8 — observability & upgrade boundary

- **G7 (observability).** The posting worker/feed must emit structured logs +
  the §VII metrics (queue lag, failed-job rate, **reconciliation mismatch
  rate**, DLQ depth) carrying `correlationId`/`tenantId` [§VII]. The
  observability **seam is 017** (it surfaces the DLQ + reconciliation state);
  015 defines the signals, 017 surfaces them.
- **G8 (upgrade gate).** ERPNext-version concerns land on the **connector
  posting adapter** — the only ERPNext-calling component (DP2 makes no outbound
  HTTP calls). The DP2 ↔ connector contract is version-independent (O-6); an
  ERPNext v15→v16 change alters the connector's internal mapping, never 015's
  DP2-facing design. **Boundary noted; not 015's to satisfy.**

## 11. Open questions — **RATIFIED** ([owner rider 011-DR-POSTING-R1, 2026-06-05](../011-erpnext-pos-reference-and-integration-foundation/decisions/posting-decision-rider-2026-06-05.md))

All five resolutions below are **RATIFIED** by the signed owner rider; the
detailed treatments are in [resolution-concepts.md](./resolution-concepts.md).
**None remains an open question.** Deviating from a ratified resolution is a
STOP-and-raise (a new signed rider is required), never a silent override.

| ID | Question | Ratified resolution (rider clause) |
|---|---|---|
| **OQ-5** | Sellable-state divergence (DP2 sellable vs ERPNext Item `disabled`/`is_sales_item`): which governs posting resolvability, and how is divergence handled? | **RATIFIED (rider R3):** a disabled / non-sales ERPNext Item at posting time **fails-to-DLQ** — **no silent fallback, no substitute item** — while **operational sellability stays DP2-authoritative** (a disabled accounting Item does NOT make the product unsellable at POS). Divergence = reconciliation case (017), never a silent override. [resolution-concepts §OQ-5] |
| **OQ-6** | Relationship between resolving a 003 unknown-item and establishing a 013 ERPNext mapping. | **RATIFIED (rider R4):** the two mechanisms are **separate operational states**: inbound unknown-items (scan → no `tenant_product`) ≠ outbound unmapped-for-posting (a `tenant_product` with no confirmed map). Resolving an unknown item creates a `tenant_product` that **still needs a confirmed 013 mapping before it can post**. 015 **MUST NOT** route posting failures into the unknown-items queue. [resolution-concepts §OQ-6] |
| **OQ-7** | Payment Entry in the first implementation slice (§5.2). | **RATIFIED (rider R1):** the **signed target is unchanged** (submitted Sales Invoice + associated Payment Entry per sale). The first implementation slice runs the **owner-ratified interim mode** — submitted Sales Invoice / outstanding AR only — explicitly **gated** and **not finance-complete**; Payment Entry posting requires the four gated extensions (DP2 tender model, 012 payment extension, connector idempotent PE creation, payment repair semantics) **before** implementation. Deriving a PE from `posTotal` is **not ratified**. [§5.2] |
| **OQ-8** | Minimal-v1 stock path when DP-014 has not shipped (§10.1). | **RATIFIED (rider R5):** absent a resolved warehouse, **fail-to-DLQ** (`unmapped_store`-class) — **never guess the ERPNext warehouse**. [§10.1] |
| **OQ-8-bis** | **Where** line→Item resolution happens: DP2-side (resolve at work-item projection, embed the ERPNext Item ref) vs connector-side (connector resolves from `tenantProductRef`). | **RATIFIED (rider R2): DP2 resolves at projection**; a failed resolution **fails-to-DLQ in DP2 before the work-item is offered**. The Connector **MUST NOT** guess Item identity, reach back into DP2 for item lookup, or maintain a second copy of DP2 mapping truth. Implementation is **gated on the `[GATED]` 012 correction/extension** (`SaleLine.erpnextItemRef` or equivalent + `tenantProductRef` description correction) — **required before 015 implementation**. [resolution-concepts §OQ-8-bis] |

## 12. Constitution Check (planning-level)

Docs-only, so the check is at the **design-intent** level; a full per-task
Constitution Check lands in 015's future `plan.md`.

| Principle | How 015 (as specified) complies |
|---|---|
| **§II Multi-tenant RLS** | The feed is tenant-scoped from the connector principal; cross-tenant work-item refs / cursors are non-disclosing 404s (012 contract); any new state table is tenant-scoped with fail-closed RLS (G3, §10.3). |
| **§III Backend authority & money** | Exact-decimal string money end-to-end, no float (§9); DP2 amounts authoritative; POS totals preserved as received (§5.5, §9). |
| **§IV Contract-first** | 015 consumes the fixed 012 OpenAPI contract; any new ERP-backed surface is a `[GATED]` contract slice first; no raw DB entities cross the wire (the work-item is a projection). |
| **§V Async workers** | Posting is async off the request path [posting §2]; the posting worker carries `tenantId`/`correlationId`, is idempotent, and surfaces failures to a DLQ (no silent swallow) [§V, §8]. |
| **§IX Source-of-truth** | DP2 owns the sale fact; ERPNext owns the GL; mapping/reconciliation never collapses authority (§5.5, §7). |
| **§X Temporal** | `businessDate` → `posting_date`; delayed sales land in the correct period; server clocks for security (§9). |
| **§XI Idempotency** | Exactly-one document per sale via `sourceSystem + externalId` + payload hash; idempotent ack (§8). |
| **§XII Object safety** | Body-supplied scope rejected on the ack; tenant/store/actor resolve from the connector principal (012 contract). |
| **§XIII Auditability & provenance** | Provenance (`sourceSystem`/`externalId`/`payloadHash`) carried into the posting; outcomes recorded; reconciliation cases traceable (§7, §8). |
| **§VIII Reproducible releases** | No schema/migration/contract/package/lockfile/CI change in this PR; every such surface is a flagged `[GATED]` follow-up (§10.3, follow-up-notes). |

No principle is violated by this planning spec. The principle that most
**constrains** the implementation is **§III/§IX** (money + source-of-truth),
addressed in §5.5 and §9.

## 13. Dependencies, gates & sequencing

> **Status superseded (2026-06-06).** The state column below is the **2026-06-05
> point-in-time** snapshot. Since then, prerequisites 1–3 have **shipped to `main`**:
> P-DP-008-LIVELOOP (#496/#497), 014-CRUD (#495), and the `[GATED]` 012
> `SaleLine.erpnextItemRef` correction (#494). For current truth see
> [plan.md → Technical Context → *Prerequisite reality*](./plan.md). Only the
> `[GATED]` `erpnext.posting.requested` event-type + 015's own data-model/tasks/
> execution-map remain outstanding.

| Dependency / gate | State (verified 2026-06-05 against the worktree from `origin/main @ 0cafd0c`) |
|---|---|
| **gated_by**: posting decision (011-DR-POSTING) | ✅ **SIGNED** 2026-06-03 (gates 012/013/015/017) |
| **gated_by**: stock-impact decision (011-DR-STOCK-IMPACT) | ✅ **SIGNED** 2026-06-03 (gates 014/015/017) |
| **depends_on**: 012 posting-feed contract on `main` | ✅ present — `posting-feed.yaml` `1.0.0-draft` (git-verified) |
| **depends_on**: 013 `erpnext_item_map` MVP on `main` | ✅ CLOSED — module + `0017` migration (git-verified); `013-RESOLVE` lands here |
| **depends_on**: 008 sale fact on `main` | ✅ CLOSED — `sales`+`sale_lines`+`0012` migration (git-verified) |
| **depends_on**: DP-014 warehouse map | ⏳ **planning chain only; SCHEMA/CONTRACT `[GATED]`+`proposed`, not built** — §10.1 minimal-v1 path |
| **prerequisite**: P-DP-008-LIVELOOP | ⏳ **GATED** (separate slice, `specs/008`) — must ship before the feed carries real work-items end-to-end (§10.2) |
| G0 repo truth | ✅ worktree from `origin/main @ 0cafd0c` |
| G2 contracts | ✅ `posting-feed.yaml` present |
| G3 / G5 / G7 / G8 | **defined, not satisfied** (planning lane) — §8, §10 |
| G9 rollout | n/a (planning lane) |

**Implementation sequencing (per the 2026-06-05 rider):**

1. `P-DP-008-LIVELOOP` (scoped under `specs/008`) — makes processed sales feedable. (Rider R6: separate prerequisite slice, never absorbed here.)
2. `014-CRUD` (+ its `[GATED]` SCHEMA/CONTRACT) — the store→warehouse map ("Update Stock ON" target).
3. The **`[GATED]` 012 contract correction/extension** (`SaleLine.erpnextItemRef` or equivalent + `tenantProductRef` description correction) — **required before 015's posting-feed implementation** (rider R2; gates ALL 015 implementation).
4. The `[GATED]` `erpnext.posting.requested` event-type registration (`packages/db`).
5. 015's own Spec-Kit chain (`plan.md` → `[GATED]` schema/contract as needed → `tasks.md` → `execution-map.yaml`), then the posting feed + worker + `015-RESOLVE` — in the **interim invoice-only/outstanding-AR mode** (rider R1).
6. **017** drains the DLQ, surfaces reconciliation + observability.
7. *(Later, separately gated — rider R1)*: DP2 tender/payment model → 012 payment/tender extension → connector idempotent Payment Entry creation → payment repair semantics → **Payment Entry posting** (completing the signed target).

---

## 14. Out of scope (explicit)

- **Tax / fiscal Egypt (ETA e-invoice)** — that is **016** (rides on a working
  posting; `etaStatus` is a nullable passthrough until then per the 012 contract).
- **Connector adapter internals** — how the connector orchestrates submit /
  retry-backoff / ERPNext API calls lives in the connector repo (behind the 012
  contract), not here.
- **Any catalog read-down concern** — the retail catalog reaches the edge by
  READ-DOWN from the Data-Pulse resolved store catalog (010); ERPNext Item =
  accounting/posting identity only (ADR-0001). 015 is **capture-UP** (posting
  feed) only; it is **never** a source of the retail catalog or prices.
- **ERPNext POS UI** — rejected as the production cashier terminal (011); not in
  this arc.
- **The P-DP-008-LIVELOOP slice itself** — prerequisite only (§10.2); its tasks /
  requirements / design belong to `specs/008` and are **not** authored, scoped,
  or restated here.
- **DP-014 warehouse mapping** — its slice; 015 only depends on it (§10.1).
- **017 sync-ops / repair API** — owns the DLQ drain + reconciliation + repair
  surface; 015 produces the state it consumes.

---

## 15. Acceptance criteria (for this planning spec)

- [ ] The posting model (§5) restates **both** SIGNED decision records with **zero
      deviations**; each normative statement cites its decision-record clause.
- [ ] The interim Payment Entry mode (§5.2) is **explicit and owner-ratified**
      ([rider R1, 2026-06-05]) — labelled **gated** and **not finance-complete**,
      with the signed target (Sales Invoice + associated Payment Entry) unchanged
      and never presented as replaced by "Sales Invoice only".
- [ ] The transport (§6) consumes the 012 contract as fixed and maps all seven
      obligations (O-1..O-7).
- [ ] 015-RESOLVE (§7 + resolution-concepts) defines posting-time item resolution,
      the confirmed-only invariant, and the unmapped→DLQ posture; OQ-5/OQ-6/OQ-8-bis
      resolutions **RATIFIED** via the 2026-06-05 owner rider (DP2-side resolution
      selected; the `[GATED]` 012 correction/extension marked required before
      implementation).
- [ ] Idempotency (§8), temporal + money (§9) are designed to the constitution
      (§III/§X/§XI) and the 012 contract.
- [ ] Inherited implementation gates (§10) are scoped, not satisfied: DP-014
      depends-on + minimal-v1 path; P-DP-008-LIVELOOP prerequisite-only
      (expectations + sequencing, **no** absorbed content); G3/G7/G8 flagged.
- [ ] Out-of-scope (§14) lists tax/fiscal (016), connector internals, catalog
      read-down, ERPNext POS UI, and the live-loop slice itself.
- [ ] No runtime / OpenAPI / DB / migration / package / lockfile / CI / connector
      / POS / Console file is touched; changed files are only under
      `specs/015-pos-sale-posting-to-erpnext/`.
