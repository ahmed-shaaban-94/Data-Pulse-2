# Feature Specification: ERPNext Reconciliation & Repair

**Feature Branch**: `017-erpnext-reconciliation-and-repair`

**Created**: 2026-06-06

**Status**: Draft

**Input**: User description: "017"

> **Arc context (not a clarification — grounding).** 017 is the named **operational
> reconciliation surface** of the ERPNext integration arc (011→017). Its scope is
> fixed by two signed/shipped predecessors that deliberately deferred their
> *machinery* here:
>
> - **015 (posting) — the `015-DLQ-DRAIN` traceability stub** (015 execution-map):
>   *"017 reads 015's `permanently_rejected` rows + reconciliation flags, surfaces
>   the mismatch reports, and exposes the repair re-post workflow (a repair must
>   resolve to the SAME `document_ref` — idempotency holds across repair; never a
>   silent rewrite)."*
> - **014 (warehouse mapping) — the §8 014↔017 carve** (014 spec, gated by the
>   SIGNED 011-DR-STOCK-IMPACT §5): **014 defines** the mismatch-class *vocabulary*
>   and *what is compared*; **017 owns** the reconciliation **run** (scheduling,
>   cadence, on-demand triggers), the persisted **mismatch reports** + surfaces +
>   alerting, the **repair API** (re-post / re-map / re-sync / DLQ drain), and the
>   retry/DLQ posture.
>
> 017 therefore unifies *posting* reconciliation (015) and *stock* reconciliation
> (014) under one operational surface: **run → report → repair**, with idempotent
> repair as the load-bearing safety invariant. It introduces **no new ERPNext
> authority** (mapping/reconciliation is never authority handover — 011-DR-STOCK-IMPACT:
> DP2 is operational on-hand truth, ERPNext is valuation) and **no outbound ERPNext
> HTTP from DP2** (the connector, separate repo per ADR 0008, is the only
> ERPNext-calling component; any ERPNext-Bin fetch is the connector's machinery,
> behind the fixed 012 contract).

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Operator reviews the posting dead-letter backlog (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

A **Tenant Admin / finance operator** opens the reconciliation surface and sees,
per tenant (and filterable by store), the list of sales (and void/refund
reversals) whose ERPNext posting **permanently failed** — each with its mismatch
class (e.g. `unmapped_item`, `unmapped_store`, `unmapped_account`, `validation`,
`closed_period`), the originating sale/terminal-event reference and its
provenance (`sourceSystem` + `externalId`), the structured rejection reason, and
when it dead-lettered. The list is paginated, sortable, and groupable by class,
so the operator can triage the backlog and understand *why* money has not reached
ERPNext.

**Why this priority**: This is the MVP and the reason 017 exists. 015 already
*produces* the `permanently_rejected` rows and the `erpnext_posting_reconciliation_total`
signal, but nothing surfaces them to a human — the backlog is invisible. Making
the backlog **visible and triageable** is the minimum that delivers value: an
operator can now see open AR-blocking failures and act outside the system
(fix a mapping, raise a ticket) even before any in-system repair exists. It is
independently shippable on top of the already-merged 015 data.

**Independent Test**: Seed a tenant with a mix of `permanently_rejected` posting
rows (different classes) + healthy `posted`/`pending` rows; call the
review/list surface as the tenant admin; confirm only that tenant's dead-letters
appear, correctly classified, with provenance + reason, paginated/sortable/
groupable, and that `posted`/`pending` rows are **absent** from the backlog.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a tenant with three `permanently_rejected` posting rows (one
   `unmapped_item`, one `unmapped_store`, one `validation`) and two healthy rows,
   **When** the operator lists the reconciliation backlog, **Then** exactly the
   three dead-letters are returned, each carrying its class, originating
   reference, provenance, structured reason, and dead-letter timestamp; the two
   healthy rows are absent.
2. **Given** dead-letters across two tenants, **When** operator A lists the
   backlog, **Then** only tenant A's rows are visible (tenant isolation; a
   cross-tenant reference is non-disclosing).
3. **Given** a backlog larger than one page, **When** the operator pages and
   sorts/groups by class, **Then** results are stable, complete, and
   gap-detectable across pages.

---

### User Story 2 - Operator repairs a failed posting by re-posting it (Priority: P2)

Once the underlying cause is fixed (e.g. a 013 item mapping is now confirmed, a
014 store→warehouse mapping is set, or a `closed_period` has reopened), the
operator triggers a **repair** of a dead-lettered posting. The repair re-makes
the work-item eligible so the connector posts it to ERPNext on the next pull.
The repair is **idempotent**: a posting that eventually succeeds resolves to
**exactly one** ERPNext document — a re-post of an already-`posted` item echoes
the existing `document_ref` and never creates a second document or silently
rewrites a submitted one.

**Why this priority**: Visibility (US1) lets operators *see* the backlog; repair
lets them *clear* it inside the system, closing the loop without manual DB
surgery. It is P2 because US1 already delivers triage value, and repair builds
directly on the surfaced backlog + the already-proven 015 ack idempotency (O-3).

**Independent Test**: Take a `permanently_rejected` posting (`unmapped_item`),
confirm the missing 013 mapping out of band, trigger repair; confirm the row
becomes eligible again (re-offered on the connector feed), the connector ack
records a single `posted` outcome with one `document_ref`, and a second repair
of the now-`posted` row is a no-op that echoes the same `document_ref` (never a
second document).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an `unmapped_item` dead-letter whose mapping is now confirmed,
   **When** the operator triggers repair, **Then** the posting becomes eligible
   again and is offered to the connector; on a `posted` ack it carries exactly
   one `document_ref`.
2. **Given** a posting that already reached `posted`, **When** a repair is
   triggered for it, **Then** the repair is a non-destructive no-op that echoes
   the existing `document_ref` — never a second document, never a rewrite of the
   submitted document.
3. **Given** a repair triggered while the underlying cause is **still** unfixed
   (the mapping is still missing), **When** the posting is re-evaluated, **Then**
   it returns to the dead-letter backlog with its class intact (no silent
   success, no infinite churn), and the repair attempt is recorded.
4. **Given** a repair request, **When** it is recorded, **Then** the originating
   immutable sale fact (008) is **never** mutated — only posting/reconciliation
   state advances (§IX).

### User Story 3 - Operator runs a stock reconciliation and reviews mismatches (Priority: P3)

The operator triggers (on demand, or on a schedule) a **stock reconciliation
run** for a tenant/store: the system compares DP2's operational on-hand (009)
against ERPNext's valuation view for the mapped warehouse (014), and produces a
persisted **mismatch report** using 014's mismatch-class vocabulary (e.g.
`match`, `quantity_divergence`, `unmapped_store`, `unmapped_item`, `dp2_only`,
`erpnext_only`, `negative_balance_flagged`). The operator reviews the report,
filters by class, and can trigger a repair (re-map / re-sync) for actionable
classes. **DP2 remains operational on-hand truth**; a divergence is a
reconciliation case to surface, never a silent overwrite of either side.

> **v1 ERPNext-read scope (research R3):** the run reads the ERPNext valuation
> side through a **connector seam** (the connector, separate repo per ADR 0008,
> owns the actual ERPNext-Bin fetch behind the fixed 012 boundary — DP2 makes no
> outbound ERPNext HTTP). In v1 the seam is **stub-tolerant**: 017's DP2-side run,
> persisted report, and repair workflow ship and are testable with a
> recorded/stub ERPNext view; the **live** ERPNext read activates when the
> connector ships (a future `[GATED]` connector→DP2 view contract). An absent
> connector view is reported (`erpnext_only` / unavailable), never a run failure.

**Why this priority**: Stock reconciliation completes the unified surface (it is
the 014↔017 carve's "017 runs it" half) but depends on 014's mapping being live
and on the connector's ERPNext-Bin fetch machinery; it is the largest and most
externally-coupled story, so it is P3. US1+US2 (posting) deliver standalone value
without it.

**Independent Test**: With a mapped store, a seeded on-hand divergence, and a
stub/recorded ERPNext-Bin view, trigger a reconciliation run; confirm a persisted
mismatch report is produced with the correct 014 classes, scoped to the tenant,
and that a repair on an actionable class is recorded idempotently without
mutating the 009 ledger.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a mapped store with a known on-hand divergence, **When** a
   reconciliation run executes, **Then** a persisted report is produced
   classifying each line per 014's vocabulary, scoped to the tenant.
2. **Given** an `unmapped_store` result, **When** the operator reviews it,
   **Then** the report names the missing mapping (it never guesses a warehouse —
   rider R5) and offers a re-map repair path, not a silent default.
3. **Given** a reconciliation run, **When** it reads DP2 and ERPNext views,
   **Then** the 009 stock ledger and the 008 sale fact are **never** mutated by
   the run — reconciliation is read + report + (idempotent) repair only.

---

### Edge Cases

- **Repair of a row whose cause is unfixed** → the re-evaluation fails again and
  the row returns to the backlog with its class intact; the repair attempt is
  recorded (audit + attempt count), never an infinite silent retry loop.
- **Concurrent repairs of the same dead-letter** (two operators) → serialized;
  exactly one repair takes effect, the other is an idempotent no-op echoing the
  resolved state — never two ERPNext documents (the 015 O-3 invariant extends
  across repair).
- **Repair of an item the connector already `posted`** (a stale backlog view) →
  non-destructive no-op echoing the existing `document_ref`; never a rewrite of a
  submitted document.
- **A reconciliation run while a posting for the same sale is still `pending`** →
  the run reports the in-flight state, does not double-classify it as a mismatch,
  and does not race the posting loop.
- **Cross-tenant / out-of-scope reference** on any list/repair/report call →
  non-disclosing not-found (§II/§XII); no existence leak.
- **A `closed_period` rejection repaired after the period reopens** → repair
  succeeds and posts into the now-open period; a repair while still closed
  returns to the backlog unchanged.
- **DLQ growth / alerting** → the persisted backlog + the `erpnext_posting_reconciliation_total`
  signal feed an operator alert when the dead-letter depth crosses a threshold;
  the alert never carries PII / money / raw payloads.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Reconciliation reporting (run → report)

- **FR-001**: System MUST surface, per tenant and filterable by store, the
  backlog of ERPNext posting **dead-letters** (015 `permanently_rejected` rows),
  each carrying its mismatch class, originating sale/terminal-event reference,
  provenance (`sourceSystem` + `externalId`), structured rejection reason, and
  dead-letter timestamp.
- **FR-002**: The backlog list MUST be paginated, sortable, groupable by mismatch
  class, and gap-detectable across pages (consistent with the 007/010 list
  conventions).
- **FR-003**: System MUST scope every reconciliation read to the caller's tenant;
  a cross-tenant or out-of-scope reference MUST be non-disclosing (§II/§XII).
- **FR-004**: System MUST be able to execute a **stock reconciliation run**
  (on-demand and/or scheduled) for a mapped (tenant, store) that compares DP2
  operational on-hand (009) against the ERPNext valuation view for the mapped
  warehouse (014), and persist the result as a **mismatch report**.
- **FR-005**: A mismatch report MUST classify each result using **014's**
  mismatch-class vocabulary (014 owns the definitions; 017 reports against them);
  017 MUST NOT invent a competing classification.
- **FR-006**: A reconciliation run MUST NOT guess a warehouse for an unmapped
  store — it MUST report `unmapped_store` and offer a re-map repair path (rider R5).
- **FR-007**: System MUST persist reconciliation reports for later review +
  audit; a report is retained (not deleted) for the operability/audit horizon.
- **FR-008**: System MUST emit/track the dead-letter depth + reconciliation
  outcome signals (building on the 015 `erpnext_posting_reconciliation_total`
  family), so operators can alert on a growing backlog; signals MUST carry no
  PII / money / raw payloads.

#### Repair (the repair API)

- **FR-009**: System MUST expose a **repair** action for an actionable
  dead-letter: a posting repair re-makes the work-item eligible so the connector
  re-posts it on the next pull (re-post); a stock-mismatch repair offers re-map /
  re-sync for actionable classes.
- **FR-010**: A posting repair MUST be **idempotent** and preserve the 015 O-3
  invariant: a posting that eventually succeeds resolves to **exactly one**
  ERPNext document; a repair of an already-`posted` item echoes the existing
  `document_ref` and MUST NOT create a second document or rewrite the submitted
  document.
- **FR-011**: A repair whose underlying cause is **still unresolved** MUST return
  the item to the dead-letter backlog with its class intact (no silent success),
  and MUST record the repair attempt (audit + attempt tracking) — never an
  infinite silent retry.
- **FR-012**: Concurrent repairs of the same dead-letter MUST be serialized so at
  most one takes effect; the others MUST be idempotent no-ops echoing the
  resolved state.
- **FR-013**: A repair MUST NEVER mutate the originating immutable sale fact (008)
  or the 009 stock ledger — only posting/reconciliation state advances (§IX).
- **FR-014**: System MUST record a platform **`audit_events`** entry (the 001
  audit pipeline, in the same transaction as the state write — the 013/014/015
  audit-in-transaction pattern) for every reconciliation run and every repair
  action (actor, tenant, store, target reference, outcome), with no raw
  payloads/PII. This is the audit-of-record; 017's own
  `erpnext_reconciliation_run` / `…_repair_attempt` rows are the **operational**
  history (the reviewable run/repair trail) — both are written atomically, never
  one without the other.

#### Boundary & authority

- **FR-015**: DP2 MUST make **no outbound ERPNext HTTP call**; any ERPNext-side
  read (e.g. the ERPNext-Bin valuation view) is the connector's machinery behind
  the fixed 012 contract. 017 consumes the connector boundary; it does not
  re-implement it.
- **FR-016**: 017 MUST NOT change ERPNext authority: mapping/reconciliation is
  never authority handover (011-DR-STOCK-IMPACT — DP2 is operational on-hand
  truth, ERPNext is valuation). A divergence is a reconciliation case to surface,
  never a silent overwrite of either side.
- **FR-017**: 017 MUST consume the fixed 012 `posting-feed.yaml` (and any
  reconciliation/repair surface it adds) as a contract-first surface; the 012
  posting feed/ack contract is read-only input to 017.
- **FR-018**: 017 is **exclusively a human operator surface** (Tenant Admin) in
  v1 — every 017 surface (list backlog, run reconciliation, trigger repair) MUST
  authenticate as the dashboard human session scheme (consistent with
  007/013/014), NOT the machine connector bearer and NOT a POS device scheme.
  The connector never calls 017: a posting repair simply re-makes a 015
  work-item eligible, and the connector re-posts it via the **existing** 012
  feed/ack it already polls — so 017 needs no new machine-facing contract.
  (Decided 2026-06-06: human-operator-only; a connector-facing reconciliation
  surface, if ever needed, is a separate future arc.)
- **FR-019**: Repair MUST be bounded — a repaired posting that keeps failing
  transiently MUST honor the same retry budget posture 015 established
  (`POSTING_RETRY_BUDGET` → dead-letter), so repair cannot create an unbounded
  re-offer loop.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Reconciliation Run**: One execution of a reconciliation (posting backlog
  snapshot, or a stock compare for a (tenant, store)). Attributes: scope
  (tenant, optional store), kind (posting | stock), trigger (on-demand |
  scheduled), started/finished timestamps, summary counts by mismatch class,
  actor (for on-demand). Append-only; never rewritten.
- **Mismatch Report / Reconciliation Result**: The persisted classified output of
  a run — per originating reference (sale / terminal event / stock line), the
  014 mismatch class, the relevant DP2 vs ERPNext values (no money in metric
  labels; report rows may carry values for the operator), provenance, and current
  state (open | repaired | accepted). Retained for audit.
- **Repair Attempt**: A record of an operator-triggered repair of a dead-letter /
  mismatch — target reference, repair kind (re-post | re-map | re-sync | drain),
  actor, timestamp, outcome (eligible-again | still-failing | no-op-echo), and
  the resolved `document_ref` when a posting repair succeeds. Append-only;
  the audit trail of the repair workflow.
- **Posting Dead-Letter (consumed, owned by 015)**: The `permanently_rejected`
  `erpnext_posting_status` rows 017 reads — NOT re-modeled here; 017 reads + can
  transition them back toward eligibility via repair (the 015 state machine
  remains authoritative).
- **Store↔Warehouse Mapping (consumed, owned by 014)**: The `erpnext_warehouse_map`
  017 reads for stock reconciliation; 017 may offer a **re-map** repair that
  drives the existing 014 mapping admin flow — it does not own the mapping.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: An operator can see the complete posting dead-letter backlog for
  their tenant (correctly classified, with reason + provenance) in a single
  review surface — 100% of `permanently_rejected` rows are surfaced, 0%
  cross-tenant leakage.
- **SC-002**: An operator can clear a dead-letter whose cause is fixed by
  triggering one repair, with no manual database access required.
- **SC-003**: A posting that is repaired and succeeds results in **exactly one**
  ERPNext document — 0 duplicate documents and 0 silent rewrites across any
  number of repeated repair attempts (the idempotency invariant holds 100%).
- **SC-004**: A reconciliation run for a (tenant, store) produces a persisted,
  reviewable mismatch report classified entirely in 014's vocabulary, with the
  009 ledger and 008 sale fact unchanged by the run (verified before/after).
- **SC-005**: A repair of a still-broken item returns it to the backlog without
  loss and records the attempt — 0 silent successes and 0 unbounded retry loops.
- **SC-006**: Operators are alerted when the dead-letter backlog depth crosses a
  configurable threshold, with no PII / money / raw payloads in the alert.

## Assumptions

- **015 is shipped** (posting feed + ack + `permanently_rejected` state + the
  `erpnext_posting_reconciliation_total` signal) — 017 reads that state; it does
  not re-implement posting. (Verified: 015 closed on `main`, PRs #501–#505.)
- **014 is shipped** (`erpnext_warehouse_map` + the mismatch-class vocabulary) —
  017 reports/repairs against 014's definitions; it does not redefine them.
- **The connector** (separate repo, ADR 0008) is the only ERPNext-calling
  component and owns any ERPNext-Bin fetch; 017 consumes the 012 contract
  boundary and makes no outbound ERPNext HTTP from DP2.
- **The operator surface is the dashboard human session** (Tenant Admin),
  consistent with 007/013/014. **Decided (FR-018):** 017 is human-operator-only
  in v1; the connector never calls 017 (repair re-makes a 015 work-item eligible
  and the connector re-posts via the existing 012 feed/ack).
- **No new ERPNext authority** is introduced; reconciliation never overwrites
  either side silently (011-DR-STOCK-IMPACT, SIGNED).
- **Repair re-uses 015's idempotency (O-3) + retry-budget posture** rather than
  inventing a new primitive — a repaired posting flows back through the same
  feed/ack loop and the same `POSTING_RETRY_BUDGET` bound.
- **Scheduling cadence** for scheduled reconciliation runs uses an
  industry-standard operational default (e.g. nightly per tenant) unless a later
  decision sets otherwise; on-demand triggers are always available. The exact
  cadence is a planning-phase detail, not a scope clarification.
- **Persistence/retention** of runs + reports follows the 001 long-horizon audit
  posture (a dead-letter / report is retained, not deleted, for the
  reconciliation/audit surface).

## Dependencies

- **015-pos-sale-posting-to-erpnext** (CLOSED) — produces the posting dead-letters
  + signal 017 consumes; the `015-DLQ-DRAIN` stub is 017's posting half.
- **014-branch-inventory-reconciliation-and-warehouse-mapping** (planning merged;
  CRUD shipped) — owns the mapping + mismatch-class vocabulary; the §8 carve
  assigns the run/report/repair to 017.
- **009-inventory-stock-ledger** (CLOSED) — the DP2 operational on-hand the stock
  reconciliation compares.
- **012-erpnext-connector-contracts** (SHIPPED) — the fixed pull/feed + ack
  contract; read-only input. Any new reconciliation/repair contract surface 017
  adds is its own `[GATED]` contract slice.
- **011-DR-STOCK-IMPACT / 011-DR-POSTING (+ rider)** (SIGNED) — the authority +
  failure-posture decisions 017 must not contradict.
