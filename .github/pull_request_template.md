## Constitution / boundary check (v3.0.0)

Tick every principle this PR touches. For ticked items, briefly state how the change complies.

- [ ] **I. Reference, Not Source of Truth**: no legacy `Data-Pulse` content copied without re-spec'ing here.
- [ ] **II. Multi-Tenant SaaS by Default**: tenant scoping is enforced at DB, API, and test layers where relevant.
- [ ] **III. Backend Authority & Data Integrity**: server-side authz, DB constraints, uniform errors, exact money handling where relevant.
- [ ] **IV. Contract-First POS Integration**: OpenAPI contracts remain source of truth; no raw DB entities in API responses.
- [ ] **V. Async Work Belongs in Workers**: webhook, sync, retry, scheduled, and fanout work is worker-bound where relevant.
- [ ] **VI. Test-First Quality**: tests were added or updated first for the behavior being changed.
- [ ] **VII. Observable Systems**: logs, metrics, request IDs, tenant IDs, and redaction rules are preserved where relevant.
- [ ] **VIII. Reproducible & Versioned Releases**: no unapproved package, lockfile, schema, or migration changes.
- [ ] **IX. Source-of-Truth Model**: Global Catalog, Tenant Catalog, Store Override, SaleLine snapshot, and provenance boundaries are preserved where relevant.
- [ ] **X. Retail Temporal Semantics**: temporal fields and historical facts are handled explicitly where relevant.
- [ ] **XI. Idempotency & External IDs**: retryable mutations and external IDs are idempotent or justified.
- [ ] **XII. Authorization & Object Safety**: IDs in bodies are not trusted; mass-assignment fields remain protected; default deny.
- [ ] **XIII. Auditability & Provenance**: audit events preserve actor, tenant, store, operation, target, correlation ID, and outcome where relevant.
- [ ] **XIV. PII & Data Lifecycle Discipline**: PII, payment data, tokens, secrets, and payloads are not logged; retention rules are respected.
