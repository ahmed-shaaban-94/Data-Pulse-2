## Visual System

The README and architecture docs use GitHub-renderable SVG and Mermaid:

- SVG assets provide a polished product-grade first impression.
- Mermaid diagrams keep technical flows maintainable in Markdown.
- Icons live under `assets/icons/` and share a restrained enterprise SaaS
  style.

## Documentation Rules

- Keep product language truthful to the current backend-first scope.
- Do not imply the dashboard frontend or POS application is implemented in this
  repository.
- Treat `packages/contracts/openapi` as the contract source of truth.
- Keep tenant isolation, auditability, and data integrity visible in
  documentation for any platform behavior.
