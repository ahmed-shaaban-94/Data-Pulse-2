/**
 * BullMQ default options — shared single source of truth (T092 + T301-partial).
 *
 * Originally landed in `apps/worker/src/queues/queue.config.ts` (PR #17 / T092).
 * This file is the relocated home: cross-cutting policy that both the
 * producer (`apps/api`) and the worker (`apps/worker`) consume must
 * not be re-declared per app, otherwise the two sides drift silently.
 *
 * Why types are structural (no `import type` from `bullmq`)
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 * `packages/shared` deliberately does NOT depend on `bullmq`. Pulling
 * BullMQ's type universe into `shared` would force every consumer of
 * `shared` (including the api, which already has bullmq) to drag the
 * whole BullMQ surface into its build graph just to read a static
 * options bag. We instead publish small structural interfaces that
 * are byte-compatible with the BullMQ shapes we care about; consumers
 * cast or spread the object into BullMQ's `JobsOptions` / `WorkerOptions`
 * at the call site. TypeScript's structural typing makes this safe at
 * compile time.
 *
 * On "DLQ"
 * --------
 * BullMQ has no separate dead-letter queue. Jobs that exhaust
 * `attempts` land in the failed-jobs Redis set with full retry
 * history. The "DLQ defaults" referenced in T092/T301 are the
 * *retention policy* for that set — `removeOnFail` below.
 *
 * On idempotency
 * --------------
 * Every consumer handler in this codebase is required to be idempotent
 * because BullMQ retries can re-deliver a job. The producer
 * (`apps/api/src/auth/email-queue.producer.ts`) sets `jobId` from a
 * deterministic hash; the processor (`apps/worker/src/email/email.processor.ts`)
 * revalidates payloads. These defaults assume that contract.
 *
 * Tunings
 * -------
 * Numbers reflect "transactional infrastructure" traffic patterns: low
 * job rate, low cost-per-retry, must-not-lose-jobs. Per-queue overrides
 * (e.g., higher concurrency for audit-fanout) belong to the queue's
 * own wiring slice, not here.
